  "description": "Hub researchers have created integrated datasets which demonstrate social and ecological similarities between the regions analysed. These datasets were then visualised as a series of simple-to-use maps showing regions that share similar characteristics and are therefore likely to support similar conservation and land-management interventions. The maps are presented alongside tables which describe core social, ecological and interactive variables for different regions.\n\nThe report also includes a decision-making tree to assist land managers in determining best-practice conservation actions. These outcomes will help to support biodiversity and ecosystems across Australia and increase the potential impact of conservation and land-management research.",

  "description": "Coastal water quality is threatened by an increasing volume of chemicals produced and used in our modern lives. These chemicals are commonly incorporated into pharmaceuticals and household items, and subsequently discharged into coastal areas from a broad range of point sources. Recently emerging contaminants include a variety of chemical (e.g. heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, nutrients) and microbiological (e.g. pathogens, antibiotic resistant microbes) sources that are discharged in sewage, stormwater, estuarine flows and industrial wastes.\n\nFor many of these chemicals, our understanding of their environmental concentrations and biological effects is limited. When new scientific information emerges to suggest that a particular contaminant may be hazardous, this is refered to as a contaminant of emerging concern (CEC). There is limited data about the environmental occurrence and biological effects of CECs, but emerging research suggests they have the capacity to be toxic.\n\nWith an increasing list of CECs detected in the environment, important questions remain unanswered around which contaminants and scientific knowledge gaps should be prioritised. This desktop study engaged CEC stakeholders from academic research, government, water utilities, and non-government organisations to collaboratively identify priority CEC issues in Australia’s marine ecosystems. The project delivers a risk-based framework for future CEC research directions and water quality management priorities.",

  "description": "This project aims to develop a climate change adaptation plan for focal threatened species and ecosystems of the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales (component 1) (already approved and underway) and the Wet Tropics of Queensland (component 2) (seeking approval for commencement 2025). \n\nComponent 1 Northern Rivers\nThe climate change adaptation plan will be designed to be embedded in planning and initiatives by local communities and governments. A bottom-up, community-based approach will be taken, working with local Landcare and species-monitoring groups, NSW North Coast Local Land Services (LLS) and Indigenous organisations. Our process will integrate with adaptation and resilience planning being undertaken by relevant local, state and federal government agencies.\nMany threatened species and several threatened ecological communities occur in the region. Significant wetlands, national parks, World Heritage areas, declared Aboriginal Areas, Indigenous Protected Areas and Indigenous Land Use Agreements are also found here. The region was home to the ‘Big Scrub’ subtropical rainforest, 75,000 ha of which was intensively cleared for agriculture. Less than 1% of this ecosystem remains. \nThe project will deliver applied research outcomes for stakeholders, including data, information and tools needed to support effective and appropriate adaptation actions for addressing climate-related risks to species and ecosystems in the region. The approaches and tools developed will be transferable to other regions.\n\nComponent 2 Wet Tropics\nThe same methodology will be used for a community-centred approach to climate change adaptation plan for focal threatened species and ecosystems developed for the Northern Rivers project. However, while the fundamentals of the methodology will remain the same, the approach will be modified to take into account the local contexts found in the Wet Tropics of Queensland; such modifications being co-developed with our partners, particularly WTMA, Terrain, FNQROC and the First Nations groups representing the twenty Rainforest Aboriginal Groups whose traditional lands fall within the Wet Tropics WHA. \nAs with Component 1 (Northern Rivers), this Wet Tropics component will deliver applied research outcomes for stakeholders and First Nations partners, including data, information and tools needed to support effective and appropriate adaptation actions for addressing climate-related risks to species and ecosystems in the region. Specific outputs and tools will be co-developed to ensure they complement existing resources and meet specific user needs.",

  "description": "The existing NESP project, Guiding the Strategic Management of Freshwater fish, was originally developed as a desktop project designed to use existing statewide datasets to then work with river managers to develop principles and approaches that can be used to manage and protect freshwater fish biodiversity in rivers and streams across Victoria. However, since the original project plan was developed, discussions with DEECA and others have led to a narrowing of focus to primarily consider threats to a small group of fishes that were once common in floodplain wetlands of the southern Murray-Darling Basin and more specifically in selected key Victorian catchments. A number of these species are now listed under National and/or State threatened species Legislation (including flathead galaxias, Murray hardyhead), while others (e.g. southern pygmy perch) have declined considerably in their distribution and abundance in recent decades and are increasingly being considered for listing Nationally in addition to existing State listings. Compared to riverine habitats, information on the status of wetland fish is comparatively sparse, and there has been limited research into, and investment in, strategies to restore local populations. Currently there is a tendency therefore to rely on restocking as the primary means for restoring local populations, but limited work to understand the success of restoration activities in the presence/absence of other management interventions. The revised project aims to fill this gap, and will generate information that will feed into regional and statewide management strategies. \nThe updated project goals remain consistent with those in the original plan, but with a much narrower geographic and habitat focus, and a more bottom-up approach, involving more on-ground sampling and greater engagement with local land-managers, including Traditional Owners. The project will synthesise existing data and knowledge about threatened floodplain species, their current distributions, current threats (including invasive species, wetland persistence, and their likely future distributions given threats they are facing now and into the future. We will also undertake a global assessment of the literature to assess the global trends in wetland restoration techniques and synthesis this information to provide advice to support the management of wetland habitats within Victoria and river-floodplain habitats more generally.\n",

Monitoring of their recovery is guided by the *Southern Right Whale Conservation Management Plan*, which aims to improve the population’s conservation status through regular assessment of population size, calving intervals, and spatial trends.\n\nThis project continued the long-term aerial survey program of southern right whales along the southern Australian coast, spanning from Perth (WA) to Ceduna (SA). Annual surveys have been conducted since 1993, providing a continuous long-term dataset for the 'western' population and supporting national assessments of connectivity with the smaller ‘eastern’ population. The surveys contribute essential data on population trends, calving rates, and movements of individuals.\n\nThe August 2022 aerial survey ensured an uninterrupted time series in the long-term population trend data. This is particularly important given the species' non-annual breeding cycle (typically every three years). Annual surveys are essential to maintain an acceptable level of precision in estimating population trends and key life history parameters. A total of 526 whales were recorded, including 247 cow–calf pairs, 31 unaccompanied adults and one yearling. Based on long-term models, this equated to a population estimate of approximately 2,675 individuals, with an average annual growth rate of ~5.3%.\n\nWhile this represents a continued population growth, results suggest a possible slowing in the rate of growth over the past 13 years (from 7.5% in 2009). The 2022 survey also recorded the lowest number of unaccompanied animals in the entire time series, extending a five-year trend of low sightings in this group. Continued monitoring of the population is needed to assess whether these changes represent longer-term shifts in population dynamics and calving intervals, and to inform adaptive management for this long-lived, slow-recovering species.",

  "description": "Inventory surveys of Australian Marine Parks (AMPs) provide a broad description of the natural assets that exist in Commonwealth waters. These data can be further explored to identify biological indicators and metrics to cost-effectively monitor the AMPs and inform the AMP Monitoring Evaluation Reporting and Improvement (MERI) system.\n\nHistorical surveys conducted under the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub inventoried natural values and ecosystem components in selected AMPs. They developed and tested standardised survey techniques to allows scientists and park managers to identify and measure the status of natural values and ecosystem components. A recent Marine Biodiversity Hub survey conducted detailed bathymetric and visual sampling of key seafloor habitat and fish assemblages in the Capes region of South-west Corner Marine Park (Western Australia). \n\nThis project analysed the Capes survey data to characterise and predict the broader distribution of natural values and ecosystem features, and to identify relevant indicators of fish and benthic assemblages for Park management. The results are presented alongside summaries of existing knowledge on natural, socio-economic, and cultural values, as well as human pressures. Recommendations include establishing national and international monitoring benchmarks and incorporating survey guidance from Traditional Owners.\n",

  "description": "More than half of the Australian land mass is now acknowledged to be part of the Indigenous estate through more than 450 Native Title determinations and over 1,230 registered Indigenous Land Use Agreements.\n\nThere is a fundamental need for better planning, prioritisation and evaluation to inform the management of this estate, while reconnecting and strengthening Indigenous peoples’ connections to their culture and their Country. This need is further strengthened by the fact that 54% of the National Reserve System is conferred through the Indigenous conservation estate in the form of Indigenous Protected Areas and jointly managed conservation reserves.\n\nThis Indigenous conservation estate supports a large number of Australia’s threatened species and their populations. Like other areas in Australia, the Indigenous estate is not immune to the major pressures that lead to ecosystem degradation and decline of biodiversity, including those impacting on threatened species and ecological communities.\n\nThe Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water has tasked the hub with identifying, prioritising and undertaking the research required to support Indigenous knowledge, the management of the Indigenous estate and the mutual benefits this will deliver to the Australian environment.\n\nSimilarly, Indigenous Australians have identified and articulated a series of research needs, particularly for the management of Indigenous Protected Areas, in their response to the outcomes of the first phase of the National Environmental Science Program.\n\nThis project is co-designing projects that respond to these needs. This project also confirms an Indigenous voice in the governance and operations of the Resilient Landscapes Hub through the refinement and final endorsement of the Indigenous Partnerships Strategy.",

  "description": "Many challenges for resilient landscapes are attributable to people – but people are an essential part of solutions that strengthen and restore resilience. Good data and information are necessary but not sufficient on their own, as outcomes also depend on social and economic values, norms and behaviours. There is a need for socioeconomic research to better evaluate, plan and implement actions.\n\nThe Resilient Landscapes Hub has been tasked with addressing several socioeconomic research priorities which could help reduce the impacts of the multiple pressures on Australia’s ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nOne priority is to evaluate the success of different environmental plans, strategies or actions (such as offsets and biodiversity markets, regulations, and changes to curriculum through Education for Sustainability principles) on biodiversity outcomes. This evaluation may use methods such as environmental economic accounting or environmental valuation.\n\nA second area of priority relates to planning approaches. This involves designing systems to analyse cumulative impact and regional planning assessments. These can inform the design of policies and plans, including offsets policies, and may include information about environmental values, costs and benefits. Regional planning could include integrated, landscape-scale planning – including strengthening the links between research and regional natural resource management planning – and improved resilience planning, particularly in the context of a changing climate and multiple interacting threats.\n\nFinally, implementation focuses on the motivations, incentives, and organisational and societal norms that influence the extent to which environmental plans, policies and actions are able to change behaviours and generate positive on-ground environmental outcomes.",

  "description": "This project will assess the current safe-haven network, which is designed to protect predator-susceptible species, especially those that are threatened. Currently, safe havens are generally designed to protect mammals from introduced carnivores, such as foxes and feral cats, and use either fenced areas or islands from which predators have been removed.\nThere is a need to develop a list that identifies other predator-susceptible, threatened species that are currently not represented in safe havens. Such a list will assist with the prioritisation of resources to support the expansion of species in safe havens.\nThis project will update the status of the network and identify additional species that could potentially be protected in safe havens. These species may be expanded from just mammals to, for example, reptiles and ground-dwelling birds.\n",

  "description": "Standardised approaches to marine monitoring are critical for ensuring data consistency, transparency, and comparability across time, regions, and sectors. The development and application of national standards and best practices provide the foundation for monitoring the condition of Australia’s marine estate. As pressures on the marine environment increase, so too does the need for robust, inclusive, and nationally consistent monitoring practices.\n\nThis project advanced the development and implementation of national best-practice standards to monitor the condition of priority values and pressures across Australia's marine estate. It built on previous work conducted by the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub through the release of Version 3 of the [*Field Manuals for Marine Sampling to Monitor Australian Waters*](https://marine-sampling-field-manual.github.io/). This version introduced three new manuals for: (1) sampling microplastics in marine and coastal environments; (2) conducting knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surveys with recreational marine users; and (3) use of the Benthic Observation Survey System (BOSS), a novel multi-camera drop platform for benthic imagery. Indigenous partners contributed to the development of the KAP and BOSS manuals, laying the foundation for future Indigenous-led monitoring initiatives.\n\nThe project identified key barriers to adoption of the field manuals and developed a set of recommendations, included nominating the manuals for international endorsement, establishing governance mechanisms, securing long-term funding, and identifying priorities for future SOP development, such as offshore renewable energy monitoring. All materials were aligned with the Ocean Best Practices System to facilitate national and international uptake.\n\nA practical implementation plan was developed to guide the future development and maintenance of national standards; promote their broader adoption; and assess their effectiveness and impact in delivering priority monitoring activities.",

Presently, very little information exists to assist managers of biodiversity adapt to climate change. At the same time, NESP projects are producing research, data and outputs that can be of assistance to land and sea managers responding to climate change.\nAn online adaptation decision support and knowledge platform will assist biodiversity managers as well as provide a platform for all four NESP hubs to house outputs relevant to climate adaptation for biodiversity. Through information synthesis, careful curation, codesign and collaboration with NESP projects, project 4.3 will build a climate adaptation knowledge platform for biodiversity.\nThe Resilient Landscape Hub has identified up to 17 projects that could be potentially linked and/or provide case studies for this project Adapt Land & Sea (i.e. formerly referred to as ‘ConservationAdapt’). This proposal is to contribute funds to develop written content for the web site/fact sheets for these relevant Resilient Landscape Hub projects and support the website development. ",

  "description": "This project is trialling the use of specially trained detection dogs to sniff out the critically endangered Victorian grassland earless dragon. The dragon – a cryptic lizard that was presumed to be extinct – was recently rediscovered in grasslands in Victoria’s west. The lizard had not been seen in more than 50 years, despite many searches. New methods are needed to find any remaining populations in the grasslands of the Victorian Volcanic Plain.\n\nThis project is supporting the [Zoos Victoria Wildlife Detection Dog Squad](https://www.zoo.org.au/fighting-extinction/fighting-extinction-dog-squad/) to train dogs to detect the Victorian grassland earless dragon by harnessing the dogs’ exceptional sense of smell. Having better ways to find the dragon is critical to its conservation by providing much-needed information about its populations, ecology and habitat use. Locating more dragons for a conservation-breeding program and insurance population is another way to save them from extinction.\n\nIf this project shows that detection dogs can successfully find this lizard, it could be a game-changer in the conservation of this and other imperilled Australian reptiles.",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nBy mobilising tourism vessels and thousands of citizens, the Great Reef Census (GRC) has demonstrated that citizen-based infrastructure can undertake reconnaissance of hundreds of reefs and garner private donor support. While these data are already used by managers, there remain core scientific questions regarding the acquisition, quality, and optimisation of such data for reef management. Here, we create a robust approach to citizen science that can be scaled up to reefs generally. Specifically, our project will (1) maximise the quality of data on key habitats by combining machine and human learning (in partnership with Dell Technologies) while conducting a rigorous testing of data quality, (2), operationalise a field deployment strategy that maximises the value of citizen data for management and mapping and (3) provides annual maps of reef state and ecological importance that feeds into decision-making by marine managers. It specifically responds to MAC Hub priority research areas 2023 (citizen science and/or new technologies in assessing condition and status of marine habitats and species). \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Maps of reef habitat type, reef state, ecological importance of reefs [spatial dataset]\n • GRC data on reef images and reef state [tabular dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "As our climate warms, marine heatwaves are becoming more intense and longer lasting. This can have detrimental consequences for ecosystems and industry alike. However, before we can confidently understand change and potential impacts, reliable baseline marine heatwave hazard information is required at scales relevant to environmental managers in the nearshore regions. This project will work to provide marine heatwave hazard maps around southeastern Tasmania to help marine managers make informed planning decisions. \n\nUnderstanding the marine heatwave hazard in the coastal zone  \nMarine heatwaves can disrupt species’ life cycles, alter habitat conditions, and threaten marine biodiversity. While the science around marine heatwaves is becoming well developed for open ocean regions where climate drivers are better understood, in coastal regions —where important habitats for species are located, as well as fisheries and aquaculture operations are concentrated—our knowledge is much less developed. Specifically, in the coastal and nearshore zones, adequately observing or modelling marine heatwaves is more challenging, as the important processes are very complex.   \n\nThis project focuses on the waters around southeastern Tasmania, an ecologically and economically important region experiencing multi-decadal ocean warming at 2-3 times the global average rate. Researchers will use available observations and high-resolution models to provide critically needed marine heatwave hazard baseline information. They will also analyse the movement and survival of key species, such as Eastern Rock Lobster and Long-spined Sea Urchins using particle tracking methods. By integrating multiple data sources, the project will improve understanding of how offshore marine heatwaves can influence the coastal zone and estuaries.   \n\nSupporting adaptation and decision making \nThis research will provide essential guidance for fisheries, aquaculture, and environmental management. For fisheries, the project will identify key retention areas for lobster and sea urchin larvae and assess how marine heatwaves influence their spread. For aquaculture, it will improve awareness to aid planning.  \n\nThe project will map the marine heatwave hazard. By delivering baseline hazard assessments, this work will equip industries and coastal managers with the knowledge needed to interpret local and large-scale background environmental conditions so that marine ecosystem and operations decision-makers are well informed when developing risk profiles for habitats, species or businesses.",

This project is building a first-of-its-kind knowledge platform to connect decision-makers with the latest insights and tools on climate adaptation, helping to safeguard ecosystems for the future.\n\n### Supporting land and sea managers with climate adaptation strategies\nClimate change is reshaping ecosystems, threatening biodiversity, and creating challenges for land and sea managers. Despite the urgent need for adaptation strategies, there is currently little guidance available to help biodiversity managers respond effectively. At the same time, NESP research is generating valuable insights, data, and tools that could support adaptation efforts, but these resources remain scattered and difficult to access.\n\nThis project will address these gaps by developing a cross-hub adaptation knowledge platform that synthesises and curates relevant climate adaptation information. By providing decision-support tools, case studies, and clear guidance on adaptation planning, the platform will empower biodiversity managers with the knowledge they need to integrate climate considerations into their work. Through collaboration with stakeholders, the project will ensure that climate data and adaptation strategies are practical, actionable, and aligned with the needs of on-ground decision-makers.",

  "description": "The Great Southern Reef (GSR) is an 8,000 km network of temperate rocky reefs stretching from Western Australia to New South Wales. Dominated by kelp forests, it is one of the world’s most biodiverse and productive marine ecosystems, supporting important fisheries, tourism, cultural values, and ecological functions. Despite its significance, kelp forests are in decline due to ocean warming, marine heatwaves, pollution, and expanding herbivore populations—threatening both biodiversity and the services these reefs provide. Evidence-based management is hindered without accurate estimates of the GSR's contribution to society and the economy.\n\nThis project delivered the first systematic synthesis of existing data on the ecosystem services and economic value of the GSR, focusing on shallow reefs (0–50 m). Market and non-market services—such as commercial and recreational fishing, tourism, carbon sequestration, and existence value—were assessed for each state in which the GSR occurs. The synthesis highlighted the high societal dependence on the GSR, with over 17 million Australians living within 50 km of its waters and significant national engagement in related economic and cultural activities.\n\nAll data inventoried by the project were aligned with national and international environmental-economic accounting standards to support future inclusion in Australia’s ocean accounting frameworks. This inventory provides the foundation for developing a national ocean account for kelp forests, and identifies the key data gaps that must be addressed to fully capture the GSR’s value and guide long-term policy and investment.",

  "description": "The system of marine parks that spans Australia’s Commonwealth waters is among the largest in the world. These parks play a major role in conserving marine life, supporting commercial and recreational activities, and protecting cultural values significant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Parks Australia has developed management plans for five regional Australian Marine Park (AMP) networks (North, North-west, South-west, South-east and Temperate East) and the Coral Sea Marine Park (CSMP). Under each management plan, a science plan sets priorities for monitoring and research to evaluate management effectiveness and identify opportunities for improvement. This prioritisation is vital given the limited knowledge across many AMPs, the technical challenges and high costs of science in remote areas, and the finite resources available for park management.\n\nBuilding on foundational work from the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub (projects [SS2](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-ss2-%E2%80%93-interpreting-pressure-profiles.html) and [D7](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-d7-%e2%80%93-supporting-monitoring-evaluation-reporting-and-improvement-system-australian.html)), this project delivered the scientific and technical advice needed to establish monitoring priorities for natural values and pressures across all AMP networks and the CSMP—completing a full national priority list for monitoring. It applied a nationally consistent four-step prioritisation framework that considered ecological importance, vulnerability to pressures, baseline data availability, and logistical feasibility. The project also updated the National Ecosystem model and Pressures & Activities datasets, conducted expert vulnerability assessments, and produced a Relative Cumulative Impact index. The combined research delivers a nationally accepted \"common language\" to describe natural values and pressures and a science-based method to derive monitoring priorities, aligned with the Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting and Improvement (MERI) system—an adaptive management framework that is globally unique and a significant step towards adaptive, integrated, place-based management.\n\nKey outputs include a national database of environmental and human-use data for each management region and a refined list of monitoring priorities for each AMP Network and the CSMP. The findings highlight major knowledge gaps—particularly in the distribution of mesophotic and rariphotic reefs, intertidal ecosystems, and recreational fishing impacts—and provide guidance for improving baseline data and pressure assessments. The prioritisation framework and data products developed through this project can be re-generated over time alongside improvements in the evidence base and our understanding of how ecosystems respond to multi-sectoral activities to support continual improvement in iterative, evidence-based park management and environmental outcomes.",

  "description": "Coastal Australia is home to 37 regularly occurring migratory shorebird species, with many protected areas including Ramsar sites designated on the basis of shorebird populations. Many migratory shorebirds are declining rapidly, and hence the focus of conservation efforts at multiple levels of government in Australia and overseas. However, trend data are now nearly 10 years old, meaning the information available to assess where conservation actions are needed most urgently and whether conservation efforts are helping species recover are outdated.\n\nTo ensure populations have the best chance at recovery and that resources are allocated where they are most likely to have the greatest positive impacts, it is critical to maintain up-to-date information on species trends. This project analysed 30 years of shorebird monitoring data collected by citizen science groups across Australia and curated by BirdLife Australia’s National Shorebird Monitoring Program to update national trend estimates, while also assessing the relative effects of human pressure and conservation efforts on population trends. In particular, it focused on 15 migratory shorebird species whose conservation status was being reassessed by the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. This project sets the stage for building the next decade of coastal shorebird conservation activity in Australia, coordinated through the national mechanism of the End User: National Migratory Shorebird Conservation Action Plan Steering Committee, with representatives from national and state governments as well as leading shorebird experts.",

  "description": "The Maugean skate (*Zearaja maugeana*) is listed as Endangered under Tasmania’s *Threatened Species Protection Act and the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999*. Its known population is small (~3,000 individuals, Macquarie Harbour, 2016) and highly restricted, having only been recorded in two isolated estuaries: Bathurst Harbour and Macquarie Harbour in south-western/western Tasmania. This constitutes one of the most limited distributions of any known extant elasmobranch.\n\nAlthough the skate was first discovered in Bathurst Harbour, most knowledge of the species stems from the Macquarie Harbour population. Only four individuals have been reported in Bathurst Harbour, with the last reported sighting in 1992. Environmental conditions in Macquarie Harbour have changed markedly since then due to anthropogenic activities in and around the estuary including historical mining, hydro-electric generation and alteration of natural river flows, and marine fish farming.\n\nPrevious research has shown clear signs of population stress and evidence of detrimental impacts of degraded environmental conditions on the Maugean Skate in Macquarie Harbour. Understanding the potential population status of the Maugean Skate in Bathurst Harbour will assist in determining conservation actions. This study used Environmental (e) DNA to determine the presence/absence of Maugean skate in Bathurst Harbour, strengthening the evidence base for effective conservation plans and specific recovery actions.",

While monitoring is commonly included in these projects, approaches are often uncoordinated, inconsistently funded, and rarely follow open science protocols.\n\nPrevious NESP-funded projects have advanced understanding of the ecology and service provision of threatened ecosystems and established targets for repair based on reference conditions (e.g. Marine Biodiversity Hub [Project B4](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-b4-underpinning-repair-and-conservation-australias-threatened-coastal-marine.html)). They also created a national database of marine and coastal restoration projects (Australian Coastal Restoration Network: [Project E5](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-e5-role-restoration-conserving-matters-national-environmental-significance.html)) and supported the development of monitoring, evaluation, reporting and improvement (MERI) systems across various sectors. Building on this foundation, the current project synthesised monitoring approaches across multiple habitat types by drawing on the collective expertise of Australian researchers. It also explored the integration of emerging technologies—such as automation, artificial intelligence, and eDNA—to improve monitoring efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nThe primary output of this project is a coordinated, open-science monitoring framework that incorporates clearly defined restoration goals and a core set of universal variables. Developed through expert consultation, the framework supports consistent benchmarking across projects while accommodating habitat-specific and goal-driven metrics. The framework promotes data accessibility, standardised definitions, and the integration of new technologies to streamline the development of future restoration projects and maximise the value of restoration monitoring.",

  "description": "Primary producers face increasing pressure from financial stakeholders, supply chains and consumers to demonstrate they farm sustainably to gain and maintain market access. A challenge is to identify management actions that can maintain or improve nature-positive outcomes without compromising farm production or profitability. Simultaneously, there are emerging opportunities for producers to diversify their income through nature markets. In collaboration with the CSIRO-led Ecological Knowledge Systems project, we will use stateand-transition models as a framework to integrate existing knowledge, expert elicitation and empirical data collection to test and validate the effectiveness of key interventions (reduced fertiliser application, strategic grazing) for improving biodiversity on ~10-15 farms in each of three geographic regions (Tasmanian Midlands, Western Victorian Volcanic Plains, Naracoorte Coastal Plain). The project will generate a stronger foundation for the sector to transition to a higher biodiversity future, inform opportunities to reduce input costs while maintaining productivity, and enable producers to leverage emerging nature markets, sustainability reporting and natural capital accounting.",

Norfolk Island is no exception, with multiple species having been driven extinct, including birds such as the white-chested white-eye, Norfolk Island kaka and Tasman starling.

Rodents are a primary threat to many threatened plants and animals on Norfolk Island, including the Norfolk Island green parrot, a priority species under the Australian Government’s Threatened species action plan 2022–2032. We urgently need to fill critical knowledge gaps on the management of rats to allow us to move toward island restoration (‘rewilding’) before the ecosystem moves into an alternative stable state.

  "description": "This project aims to identify practical solutions for catchment-scale restoration and threatened-species recovery in south-east Queensland (Qld). Recent extreme weather events (causing severe droughts, heat waves, wildfire and floods), habitat degradation and invasive species are posing increasing risks to the resilience and long-term persistence of highly valued and threatened freshwater species and the integrity of critical wetland habitats in the region. The project will focus on the Mary River (Moonaboola) catchment in Queensland – a hotspot of threatened freshwater and riparian species (including the Mary River turtle, Australian lungfish, giant barred frog and water mouse) that flows into the Ramsar-listed Great Sandy Strait, adjacent to the K’gari (Fraser Island) World Heritage area.\nBy working with local catchment natural-resource management (NRM) groups, Traditional Owners, governments and other stakeholders, this project will:\n• fill critical knowledge gaps on threatened species distributions and habitat requirements, ecological and cultural values, and threats\n• prioritise on-ground restoration actions to benefit multiple threatened species\n• undertake targeted implementation trials of habitat-restoration measures for key species\n• design a monitoring program to evaluate restoration success.\nThe project will deliver applied research outcomes to support ecosystem restoration after extreme events and planning for threatened-species recovery at national and state levels. The approaches developed and trialled in this project will be transferable to other catchments and threatened species. ",

  "description": "This project is using the western Cape York Peninsula and south-east Gulf of Carpentaria region as a case study to examine the relevance of existing risk-assessment frameworks and biodiversity maps for a regional approach to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).\n\nTo ensure biodiversity is protected, individual developments in northern Australia are currently assessed under the EPBC Act and other state planning legislation. However, there is a need to take a broader regional approach to assessing risks posed by the cumulative impacts of multiple developments.\n\nThe Cape York Peninsula and southern Gulf of Carpentaria region in Queensland is area of particular interest for future development. This includes proposals for mining, and water storage and extraction for irrigated agriculture. Each of these can impact water resources, biodiversity and culturally significant locations and values.\n\nAlthough the predicted impacts from individual developments may appear to be relatively minor, there is a risk that the ‘tyranny of small decisions’ could culminate in unexpected consequences for water quality, biodiversity and cultural values. This issue therefore provides a potential case study for an integrated, regional approach to identifying risks from development to environmental and cultural values.\n\nIn the first phase of the project, we are focusing on compiling information that can inform or be used in a future risk-assessment process. This includes collating tools, previous research outputs and a broad range of stakeholder perspectives so that the risk-assessment process is applicable across the study region and robust in a variety of situations. Additionally, we are examining current biodiversity maps, which are based on suitable habitats, to identify biodiversity hotspots, and compare these hotspots with potential water development areas.\n\nDuring the second phase we will work with a broader range of stakeholders to assess and refine the information collected in the first phase. Our team will then assess the information in the context of decadal patterns in water flows, possible future trends, and how these patterns might impact ecosystem productivity, health and cultural values over the long term.\n\nAs of October 2023, the project has been extended to include a third phase, where we will develop ecohydrological rules by integrating the research findings from phases 1 and 2, and studies in previous NESP and TRaCK projects, and others. This information will be used to inform water planning for the Gulf rivers. We will use new approaches for spatial mapping of water persistence into freely available models for water planning.\n\nThrough this project, we are providing information to improve outcomes for environmental and cultural values from the decision-making processes relevant to developments in the context of the EPBC Act and other risk-assessment schemes. We are also contributing to integrated planning and assessment work within an Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) Environment Assessments Qld contract project and linking with the Marine and Coastal Hub’s project Supporting regional planning in northern Australia.",

  "description": "Coastal and marine environments are increasingly exposed to pollution from land-based sources, including wastewater. With the majority of Australians living near the coast, household chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and plastics can enter the ocean via wastewater treatment plant outfalls.

However, current monitoring programs focus on a limited set of contaminants, leaving major gaps in our understanding of the presence, concentration, and ecological effects of emerging pollutants in the marine environment.\n\nThis project addressed this problem by: (1) identifying priority pollutants of concern; (2) determining concentrations of Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CEC) at a range of wastewater outfall sites with varying hydrodynamic settings; and (3) assessing where environmental impacts are likely to be greatest. It focused on five key pollutant groups: microplastics, nutrients, heavy metals, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), and antimicrobials. Hydrodynamic modelling was used to evaluate residence times and pollutant dispersal in selected marine settings, and field sampling was conducted to assess contaminant levels and potential ecological impacts on the lower food web. The project built on the findings of NESP MaC [Scoping Study 1.16](https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/project/1-16/), which identified the need for impact assessments for CECs.\n\nThe project generated new knowledge to inform risk assessments of emerging contaminants in the marine environment and provides recommendations for prioritising future monitoring and investment. It also enhances access to wastewater discharge data through continued development of the [National Outfall Database](https://nod.org.au/).",

  "description": "Australia faces a number of major pressures that lead to the degradation of our ecosystems and the decline of our biodiversity, including our threatened flora and fauna. The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration aims to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems. Consistent with this, the Australian Government aims to restore degraded habitats and improve species recovery.\n\nAn evidence base built on current practices, agreement on key knowledge gaps limiting improved restoration and recovery actions, and trial of potential solutions are urgently needed.\n\nPractical restoration solutions at the landscape scale (e.g. replanting and island arks) and species-recovery interventions (e.g. captive breeding and translocations, and other conservation strategies) will be considered in this project to identify research projects that restore and enhance resilience through ecosystem restoration and species recovery.\n\nThis includes taking a whole-of-ecosystem approach to address the need for a range of management strategies required to capture genetic diversity (e.g. seed-banking), safeguard against extinctions, and support large-scale restoration of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, particularly following extreme events such as bushfires, droughts and floods.\n\nThis project establishes the foundation for the hub’s research on practical solutions for landscape restoration and species recovery, and considers both terrestrial and freshwater species and ecosystems.",

  "description": "Australia is home to more than 1,900 species and ecological communities that are listed as threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable) under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). This number will increase significantly during the life of this second phase of the National Environmental Science Program (NESP), due to climate change and the 2019–20 bushfires.\n\nIn addition, there are more than 150 species – only some of which are listed as threatened – that are listed as migratory under the EPBC Act in response to Australia’s responsibilities under the global Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn Convention) and several bilateral agreements. All these listed entities are deemed by the Australian Government to be matters of national environmental significance.\n\nThe Resilient Landscapes Hub has been charged with leading the cross-cutting ‘Threatened and migratory species and threatened ecological communities’ initiative to support policy development, program management and regulatory processes to protect Australia’s environmental assets in terrestrial, Ramsar and marine environments. This project will provide the research foundation for this initiative and will also identify projects that will be undertaken by the hub to address the cross-cutting initiatives coordinated by the other 3 NESP hubs.\n\n**NESP cross-cutting initiatives:**\n\n1. Threatened and migratory species and threatened ecological communities\n    - research relevant to the environmental assessment of development proposals affecting listed entities identified as high priority by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water\n    - monitoring and management of species and ecological communities after extreme weather events (in collaboration with the [Monitoring resilient landscapes project](https://nesplandscapes.edu.au/projects/nesp-2/monitoring-resilient-landscapes/)), including the evaluation of approaches to the biodiversity impacts of such events (in collaboration with the Marine and Coastal Hub and the Climate Systems Hub)\n    - coordinated regional approaches to the assessment, monitoring and management of listed entities\n2. Protected place management (led by the Marine and Coastal Hub)\n    - identify key drivers of resilient populations and ecosystems across protected areas\n    - inform the improvement of governance mechanisms for protected places\n3. Climate adaptation (led by the Climate Systems Hub)\n    - model the impacts of passing thresholds for species resilience or ecosystem transitions\n    - improve adaptation measures, including conservation introductions and habitat engineering\n    - identify climate adaptation information needs of land managers and communities\n4. Waste impact management (led by the Sustainable Communities and Waste Hub)\n    - understand the impact of waste and pollution on our natural ecosystems\n    - evaluate the direct and indirect impacts of chemicals and pollutants on terrestrial and freshwater ecological communities.",

Project activities include risk assessment and recovery planning through desktop reviews and expert workshops, as well as field surveys and laboratory studies in the high priority Bloomfield River. The project will involve scientific and community stakeholders from Universities, Government, NGO’s, NRM groups and Indigenous groups. The project will deliver applied research outcomes to support freshwater fish species management after extreme events and planning for rare and threatened species recovery at national and state levels. The approaches developed and trialled in this project will be transferable to other catchments and threatened species.

  "description": "This project is a three-year investment to develop guiding principles and frameworks to help governments, civil society and communities undertake best practices in adaptation. It supports the NESP Climate Adaptation Initiative to answer important questions about how Australia is adapting to climate change. \nIn a changing climate, adaptation is crucial for the well-being and prosperity of all Australians. Supported by solid decision-making frameworks, successful adaptation is built from the best available science and evidence.\nGovernments and organisations are increasingly considering future climate risks as part of the adaptation planning and implementation processes. To guide best practice and form a national picture of what works well, there is much to learn from plans and action already in progress.\nThis project has explored ‘enablers’ of adaptation to understand how adaptation practitioners can help overcome barriers they face. It has also developed guiding principles on what best practice adaptation looks like. \nIn 2025 we released the Australian Adaptation Database, Australia’s first national climate change adaptation stocktake. The Australian Adaptation Database is helping to understand Australia’s progress toward climate change adaptation, collecting and categorising a sample of adaptation activities happening across different scales, sectors and geographic locations.

  "description": "Rocky reefs on Australia's temperate continental shelf support diverse ecological communities, including corals, sponges, mobile invertebrates, fish, and marine mammals. These habitats underpin important natural, economic, and cultural values and are subject to pressures from fishing, shipping, and climate change. Rocky reefs are key features of many Australian Marine Parks (AMPs), and improving knowledge of their extent and condition is essential for effective management and evaluation of conservation outcomes - particularly in offshore areas where seafloor habitat data is limited.\n\nThis project addressed knowledge gaps on the extent and distribution of seabed habitats by focusing on rocky reef systems within the South-west and South-east Marine Parks Networks. It built on previous research from the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub by collating and analysing existing seafloor data, and deploying drop cameras at priority sites (selected in consultation with Parks Australia and other end-users) to validate seafloor habitat extent and type. This new survey data was incorporated with newly developed data workflows to generate ecosystem models of reef and soft sediments, and broad-scale ecosystem classes - with a focus on workflows enabling rapid update of products and ensuring consistency across mapping outputs. These data products directly support NESP Marine and Coastal Hub Project 2.3 ([Improving knowledge transfer for AMP management](https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/project/2-3/)).\n\nThe project team worked with Indigenous Rangers and organisations in the South-west region to identify opportunities for collaboration, incorporate cultural knowledge into research design, and support knowledge exchange through field-based activities and on-country engagement. The project aimed to strengthen both established and emerging relationships, building on existing collaborations between University of Western Australia (UWA) researchers and the Esperance Tjaltjraak Native Title Aboriginal Corporation (ETNTAC) on complementary projects. UWA had also previously partnered with the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council (SWALSC), in consultation with the South West Boojarah (now Karri Karrak) and the Undalup Association, to support cultural mapping and biodiversity surveys under the NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub. These partnerships informed the project’s cultural engagement approach and laid the groundwork for ongoing collaboration.\n\nOutcomes of this work included improved capacity for AMP managers to identify and monitor rocky reef habitats and key natural values, assess management effectiveness, and support initiatives such as marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based fisheries management, and contribute to emerging frameworks such as ocean accounting. It also helped to guide the targeting of future surveys, particularly in ecosystems with high conservation value.",

  "description": "Advancing Australia’s Earth System Model.\nTo better understand Australia’s changing climate we need a Climate and Earth Systems Model tailored to our conditions and requirements.\n\nACCESS (Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator) is a state-of-the-art climate and earth system model to simulate the entire Earth’s climate. It’s used to understand the behaviour of the climate and its interactions with various components of the Earth system, including the carbon cycle. ACCESS provides important and unique climate data to inform considerations of climate risk, mitigation pathways, adaptation policy and decision-making, for Australia.  \n\nThis project focuses on developing the next generation ACCESS Earth System Model to enhance our understanding of climate processes globally with a focus on the Australian and Indo-Paciﬁc regions. This is to support policy relevant science in line with the Paris Agreement, to underpin regional climate projections, and to contribute to international modelling initiatives such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).\n\nOne of the main uses of ACCESS is to provide input for downscaling to derive regional scale climate information for Australia’s states and territories. ACCESS can also be used to explore a range of future climate scenarios at the global scale. Within this project and the Climate Systems Hub it has been used to explore areas such as sea surface temperature projections for the Great Barrier Reef, climate variability, climate stabilisation, including impacts on the Southern Ocean. It can also be used along with other global models to explore the impacts of temperature overshoots on marine ecosystems, to assess the implications of net-zero CO2 emissions on regional climate and to estimate future regional carbon budgets.",

  "description": "Booderee National Park has been controlling foxes in the park for 20 years. In that time, several attempts have been made to reintroduce locally extinct species. These include the eastern quoll – a priority species under the Australian Government’s [Threatened species action plan 2022–2032](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/biodiversity/threatened/action-plan). Sadly, the success of these reintroduction programs has been repeatedly hampered by fox incursions and subsequent catastrophic predation.\n\nWe’re providing improved local data and broader ecological knowledge about foxes. This will help park managers and local Traditional Owners develop tailored management interventions for the park and apply best-practice fox management in the medium term to long term.\n\nThis is a collaborative project, involving on-ground work by hub researchers, national park managers and local Wreck Bay Bherwerre Rangers. As part of the project, rangers will be trained in the use of VHF telemetry equipment, animal handling and camera trapping. The involvement of Bherwerre Rangers will link to other hub initiatives, including the ‘[Indigenous monitoring platform](https://nesplandscapes.edu.au/projects/nesp-rlh/indigenous-monitoring-platform/)’ project.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub study - Developing an Integrated Pest Management Framework for Feral Pigs in Coastal Environments. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nFeral pig populations are recognised as a current and future threatening process across most of northern Australia’s species and ecosystems. They severely impact 1) threatened species, such as marine turtles, with up to 90% of egg and hatchling mortality attributable to feral pig predation, 2) culturally important places and 3) coastal wetlands, leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions. To date, feral pig control efforts across northern Australia are small-scale. What data we have suggests pig populations remain high, despite the significant annual investment in control, and there is currently no published evidence that quantifies a predictable relationship between control activities that reduce feral pig populations and the reduction of impacts in different habitat types. A new approach is needed. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a well-established approach to pest management in agricultural contexts and, over the last decade, has been successfully adapted for and applied to protecting biodiversity from invasive pest species. The aim of the project is to develop an IPM approach for effective feral pig control for biodiversity and cultural values protection, in coastal wetlands and ecosystems in northern Australia. The science-based IPM approach, informed by workshops with stakeholders and experts, will be implemented in up to three case study areas, principally by Indigenous Land and Sea management organisations and their partners, with data-driven analysis of effectiveness and recommendations for future evolution of the Strategy. This project addresses the Australian Government’s national environmental priorities through mitigating impacts on threatened species, innovation in monitoring and increasing the participation and capacity of Traditional Owners and stakeholders.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • feral pig management case study sites [spatial dataset]\n • aerial survey data and observational data [tabular, imagery]\n • model [software]\n • final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nInvestment in restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems is increasing due to concerns around habitat loss, water quality, decline in fish catches, coastal inundation and erosion, and climate change. Coastal wetlands, including mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses and tidal freshwater forests like Melaleuca have significant capacity to sequester carbon dioxide contributing to blue carbon stocks. They provide habitat for coastal fisheries and a range of biodiversity and are culturally important. This project aims to develop a method, that can be widely used across Australia, to prioritise coastal wetland restoration sites for Blue Carbon projects based on a value-based framework that considers biophysical suitability, balancing of wetland values, condition, regulation and policy adequacy, and economic feasibility. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Spatial data outputs from the Fitzroy Basin QLD, south-west WA and northern Australia analysis [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThere is an urgent community-driven need to develop appropriate seagrass restoration approaches at scale for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (CKI). Fast-tracking larger-scale restoration research is required to prevent imminent collapse and functional extinction of seagrasses at CKI due to past disturbance and current green turtle grazing pressure. This project builds on pilot studies to design and establish a network of larger-scale turtle exclusion areas where locally appropriate restoration approaches can be refined. At the same time, this will provide “seagrass refuges” to initiate recovery, monitor ecological effects, and provide for future restoration efforts. The project has been co-developed with the CKI community and Parks Australia, addressing their highest research priority identified in the newly established Cocos (Keeling) Islands Marine Park. The project will provide an action plan for ongoing interventions and strategies to future-proof local seagrasses and support seagrass-dependent species, such as green turtles and fish, in the long term.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • exclusion zones experimental data [spatial & tabular dataset]\n • environmental monitoring dataset [tabular data]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThis project will partner scientists with First Nations Ranger groups to assess population abundance, distribution and by-catch survival for sawfish species in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria.  This project will develop capability in First Nations Ranger Groups that will directly assist with developing baseline status and trends for sawfish species in Australia (including the largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis, which is a priority species: https://www.dcceew.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/threatened-species-action-plan-2022-2032.pdf). Developing sampling and monitoring capability within First Nations Ranger groups in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria will increase the number of tissue samples for close kin mark recapture (CKMR) population estimates, potentially reducing the present reliance on the fishing industry to collect samples, and ultimately enable sawfish population trajectories to be measured. \n\nThe CSIRO project team will facilitate capacity building of four Ranger teams within the CLCAC Normanton, Gangaliida and Garawa (Burketown), Wellesley Islands and Ngumari Waanyi (Gregory) to undertake sawfish surveys in the Southern Gulf.  The training will build the skills of the Rangers to undertake sawfish surveys to collect tissue samples, distribution data and satellite tagging on CLCAC sea country. Tissue samples collected will contribute directly to the current NESP Sawfish project 3.11 “Multi-fishery collaboration to assess population abundances and post-release survival of threatened sawfish in northern Australia”, which is focused on working with the commercial fishing industry. These samples will be used to obtain baseline estimates of sawfish population status required to monitor population trends. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Catch data from research surveys and/or indigenous ranger programs (Tabular data)\n • Tissue samples collected by research and or indigenous ranger programs\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub study - Project 3.12 – Closing the gap in bycatch reporting and population assessment of sea snakes in Northern Australia\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nVenomous sea snakes comprise a significant component of the bycatch of coastal trawl and trap fisheries across northern Australia. Safety concerns and difficulties in species identification by crew members mean that most sea snake interactions are inaccurately reported. By partnering with commercial operators and fisheries agencies, this project will develop an observer program to train crew members, enabling: i) improved safety, accuracy, and consistency of sea snake bycatch reporting, ii) generation of broadscale data to assess species- and fisheries-specific population status for at least 20 species of sea snakes, two of which are EPBC-listed as critically endangered, and iii) the reduction in disparity between fishery and fishery independent reporting of sea snake bycatch.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Spatial maps of species distribution [spatial dataset]\n •  Key life history data (reproductive output, growth rates, population diversity and connectivity) [tabular dataset]\n •  Training materials for sea snake identification, safe handling and bite first aid [written and visual material]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This project critically evaluates climate models to improve our confidence in projections of rainfall drivers, and predictions of extreme events like land-falling tropical cyclones under a future climate state. By enhancing our confidence in the modelling, Australia’s climate-related decisions and risk management strategies will be informed by the best possible evidence.  \n\nIncreasing confidence in modelling Australia’s future weather and climate hazards \nGlobal and regional climate models are essential tools to predict climate hazards and extreme events, helping us understand how our world will change in a warming climate. Confidence in the reliability of modelled climate projections for Australia heavily depends on the models‘ capability to simulate Australia’s rainfall, temperature, and climate processes that affect extreme rainfall, such as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Under a warming climate, local factors and land surface changes could affect tropical cyclones and the rainfall they bring. This project takes the next step by closely examining climate model simulations to better understand key climate processes and extreme events.\n\nBy assessing past and future trends, the project will refine our understanding of how climate change may shape Australia’s climate. Through detailed case studies, researchers will evaluate climate models against observed events, providing clearer insights into whether current projections accurately reflect future conditions. These findings will support evidence-based policy decisions and improve risk management strategies.\n\nStrengthening confidence in decision-making around future climate hazards through case studies \nAnother key focus is enhancing model evaluation to offer critical insights for climate risk assessors, including the Australian Climate Service (ACS). Improved projections will support governments, industries, and ecosystem managers in making informed decisions on climate risks.\n\nThe project’s findings will also contribute to better forecasting capabilities for climate models like ACCESS, offering more accurate predictions for extreme rainfall, tropical cyclones, and other critical risks. This will help inform responses in areas such as water and ecological management, infrastructure planning, and emergency preparedness — equipping stakeholders with tools to mitigate the impacts of future extreme events.",

  "description": "Resilient, productive and sustainable landscapes support Australia’s rich biodiversity and agricultural and tourism economies, and are central to every Australian’s identity and wellbeing.\n\nIndigenous Australians’ cultural practices have sustainably managed these landscapes for millennia. However, our rangelands, agricultural and peri-urban landscapes – and even our protected areas – face increasingly complex environmental challenges. These challenges erode landscape condition and undermine capacity to recover from threatening processes and extreme events.\n\nTo protect Australia’s landscapes and the services they provide, merely maintaining resilience will not be enough, particularly given the changing climate. Instead, we need to find new ways to enhance and restore resilience.\n\nEnvironmental research has played a critical role in articulating the key threats to the resilience of our landscapes by:\n\n- describing declines in landscape condition, species abundance and distributions\n- predicting future threats\n- proposing and prioritising actions that should be taken to address them.\n\nSuch research has been critical for raising awareness about the magnitude of the threats to biodiversity and the urgent need to address them.\n\nDespite progress on identifying and prioritising threats, surprisingly little research in ecology and environmental science has actually focused on solutions.\n\nThe Resilient Landscapes Hub’s research program is based on a proposed approach we are calling ‘solutions science’. This user-driven, solutions-focused, co-research model brings academic and non-academic partners together to address the scientific and societal challenges of strengthening and restoring resilience in Australia’s landscapes.\n\nThis project focuses on developing and testing better ways to do applied environmental science. This includes supporting the development and implementation of the core components of our solutions-science approach.",

  "description": "This project aims to improve ecosystem restoration in Australia, with a particular focus on improving biodiversity monitoring of restoration projects. It will achieve this by undertaking 3 linked activities.\n• Activity 1: stakeholder workshop\n• Activity 2: examining methods used for restoration monitoring and evaluation\n• Activity 3: evaluating biodiversity outcomes of key restoration projects.\nThis research is foundational for enhancing biodiversity recovery, strengthening restoration program delivery, encouraging informed restoration investments, and meeting national environmental standards. It directly addresses knowledge gaps around restoration identified in the Australia State of the Environment 2021 report and current national priorities for biodiversity conservation and restoration.\nNote that this project is Phase 2 of the ‘Restoration by design’ project. Phase 1 is a small project currently underway (4.5 Phase 1: September 2023 – June 2024) which includes running a co-design workshop (planned for the first quarter of 2024) with a subset of stakeholders identified in this proposal. Project 4.5 Phase 1 is key to Project 4.5 Phase 2 of this project, as it is the formal start of the complex and time-consuming process of identification and consultation with stakeholders. Project 4.5 Phase 2 also aims to begin development of the program logic required for key parts of the project more broadly – specifically, the inclusion/exclusion criteria of restoration monitoring methods (there are many) and the inclusion/exclusion criteria for case studies to include in our detailed analysis here (again, there are many).",

  "description": "Marine and coastal wetlands provide extensive ecosystem services—protecting shorelines, improving water quality, supporting healthy fisheries, promoting tourism, storing carbon, and holding cultural significance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Like many wetlands around the world, Australian wetlands continue to be threatened, degraded, and lost due to climate change, development, and other human activities.\n\nTo support the Australian Government’s development of a national wetland inventory, this project assessed the current state of coastal wetland mapping across five key areas: seagrass, saltmarsh, intertidal macroalgae, shorebird habitat, and blue carbon. It identified major knowledge and inventory gaps through a combination of literature review and consultation with 73 end-users and experts, resulting in 25 targeted recommendations to guide future mapping and data integration.\n\nA summary of the status of mapping habitat attributes and ecosystem services such as blue carbon, coastal protection and shorebird habitat is available in the project's Final Technical Report. This report incudes recommendations to guide investment in high-demand areas and support nationally consistent wetland management and reporting to address key knowledge gaps.",

  "description": "The Queensland Threatened Lizard Survey (2021–2026) conducted surveys and fieldwork on the eleven species of threatened squamate (lizard and snake) in Queensland. This resulted in the rediscovery of Lyon’s grassland striped skink, which had not been seen since 1981 (42 years). The surveys also found a new site for the McIlwraith Range leaf-tailed gecko, which was formerly known from a handful of sightings at one site.\n\nImportantly, the surveys for seven other threatened Queensland squamate species resulted in improved knowledge of the distribution of these species and the threats that they face. The survey work did not detect either the Fassifern blind snake (not seen since 1992) or the Gravel-downs Ctenotus (not recorded since 1984). Overall, this project has improved our knowledge of the conservation status of the most imperilled squamate species in Queensland. \n\nThe research built on the findings of a [comprehensive review of the conservation status of Australian lizards and snakes carried out in 2017](https://ebooks.publish.csiro.au/content/action-plan-australian-lizards-and-snakes-2017), and a project to [identify the reptile species most at risk of extinction](https://www.publish.csiro.au/pc/pc20033) over the next 20 years.

  "description": "Climate change and habitat loss pose significant threats to the fauna of Western Australia's southwest, a region recognized as a globally important biodiversity hotspot. Over recent decades, rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall, compounded by habitat loss, have led to numerous local extinctions. As climate change and habitat fragmentation continue to intensify, the risk of further extinctions grows.\nTo address these challenges, conservation landscape corridors have been proposed as an important solution. These corridors aim to enhance species dispersal by facilitating gene flow between fragmented fauna populations, thereby increasing their access to larger habitats and improving their resilience to climate change by boosting their adaptive capacity. However, ensuring these corridors achieve maximum effectiveness requires a strong understanding of where they are likely to be best positioned within the landscape, as well as the minimum habitat requirements for them to be effective for the species they are intended to support.\nOur research aims to enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of existing landscape corridors within the megadiverse Fitz-Stirling region by conducting intensive surveys across multiple tenure types to inform habitat suitability models for a suite of target threatened species including chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii), quokka (Setonix brachyurus), dibbler (Parantechinus apicalis), and malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata). Additionally, using reptiles as a surrogate for broader small vertebrate communities, we will use genetic data to map dispersal resistance across the broader landscape to identify optimal areas for future restoration. The combination of these approaches will allow us to determine how well current corridors facilitate species movement and gene flow while also guiding the strategic placement of new corridors and restoration efforts to maximize their impact on biodiversity conservation.",

The mass mortality of Australian flying-foxes at roosts during heatwaves has been well documented, with future extreme heat events considered the greatest threat to their survival. This project aims to improve our understanding of the local thermal environments of SFF roosts across their range, which is a critical aspect of their sensitivity to the increasing risks imposed by climate change. By doing so, this project will improve species management through the provision of tools to mitigate the devastating impacts of future extreme heatwaves and advise managers on effective interventions. This project addresses national priorities by providing adaptive solutions to support the recovery of a threatened species and in developing capacity to help reverse the decline in Australia’s natural environment.\n",

  "description": "Currently, building energy efficiency software uses historical climate data to assess performance. By exploring new approaches to incorporate future weather and heat extremes into building energy efficiency modelling, this project is helping to guide the development of more energy-efficient, climate-resilient buildings.  \n\nCo-designing new approaches to incorporate future climate projections into building energy efficiency modelling \nWe must consider our changing climate when designing buildings with an expected lifespan of approximately 50-70 years, to ensure occupants are comfortable and healthy, especially during extremes such as heatwaves. By combining the expertise of climate scientists and industry practitioners, we will develop a new methodology and test it with case studies and real-world applications of prototype future average and extreme weather files across Australia.   \n\nShaping the design of energy-efficient buildings for the 2070s and beyond \nThrough co-design with policy and industry experts, this project aims to contribute to improved policy outcomes for NatHERS (Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme) and NABERS (National Australian Built Environment Rating Scheme), as well as influencing the 2028 update to the National Construction Code for residential buildings. We will pilot the new methodology with case studies and real-world applications of the new climate files with industry practitioners across Australia. By co-developing fit-for-purpose future average and extreme weather files, we are progressing towards Australian buildings being built to efficiently cope with more frequent and intense heatwaves.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Regional planning in northern Australia: Building a community of practice and sentinel case studies for supporting improved approaches to achieve ESD\". \n\nThis project grows momentum from NESP MAC Hub Project 1.32, which engaged northern Australians on the need for improved regional planning to deliver Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) outcomes. Project 1.32 identified Stage 2 investment to build: (i) a strong regional planning community of practice across the north; and (ii) three longer-standing sentinel case studies for improving regional planning practice within northern regions (WA, NT and Qld). In a methodological sense, the northern Australian community of practice will build on the network foundations established in Project 1.32, and will focus on scanning best practice approaches across the north, exploring innovative ways to communicate these approaches, and ensuring the network is strengthened through regular newsletters and targeted symposiums. The sentinel case study approach will inform policy and practice improvement at the jurisdictional and Commonwealth scales, and will apply Governance Systems Analysis approaches developed under previous NERP and NESP investments. This innovative method employs highly deliberative and evidence-based approaches to the practical analysis of complex governance systems in highly contested landscapes like northern Australia.  \n\nGiven the emerging Commonwealth focus on regional planning effort based on the Samuel review, this project represents perfect timing to focus on best practice, including knowledge management, as well as the opportunity to support emerging Commonwealth, State and Territory efforts regarding these reforms. It particularly addresses the headline issue identified in the MaC Hub 2023 Research Plan which seeks to “address the governance requirements and barriers for regional planning nationally”. This particularly includes an emphasis on northern Australia (i.e. de-risking landscapes). \n\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Case Study Governance Analysis [dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nTo improve sawfish reporting and obtain an estimate of sawfish abundance and stock structure, a large-scale collaborative project is proposed between industry, State and Commonwealth agencies and lead research institutions to gather tissue samples from across northern Australia. The project will have a focus on developing trust between research and the commercial fishing industry that will achieve the following:\n\n-\tIndustry led reporting and sampling programs will be established throughout Australia’s northern fisheries. \n-\tTissue samples will be used to assess sawfish abundance and stock structure using Close-Kin Mark-Recapture (CKMR). \n-\tEstimates of post-release survival will be obtained from satellite tagging and improved reporting. \n-\tData on abundance and post release survival will be used to assess the sustainability of sawfish bycatch.  \n\nThe research also aims to improve reporting of sawfish along with other EPBC listed species in northern Australian fisheries. If enough tissue samples are collected, close kin mark recapture will enable estimates of adult population size for four species of sawfish. Post release survival and abundance estimates will be used to determine the sustainability of sawfish captured as bycatch in state, territory and Commonwealth Fisheries. Improved estimates of bycatch, population connectivity, adult abundance and post release survival were identified as the highest research priorities in the Sawfish and River Shark multispecies recovery plan. \n\nWithin Australia, three out of the four occurring species are listed as Vulnerable and Migratory under the EPBC act (Pristis pristis, P. zijsron and P. clavata). The fourth Australian species, narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata) is listed as a Migratory species. Both A. cuspidata and P. pristis are currently under nomination to be up-listed to Endangered under the EPBC act. The Freshwater Sawfish Pristis pristis is also listed in the Threatened Species Strategy - 100 priority species for fish. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Sawfish catch data  [spatial dataset]\n • Tissue samples and sequencing data \n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThis project will map the reefs of the northern Australian seascape, from central Western Australia, through to western Cape York in Queensland. Reefs are hotspots of conservation as they provide habitat for numerous marine species but are poorly mapped for much of northern Australia. This project will deliver datasets of reef boundaries, satellite imagery optimised for the marine environment, and geomorphic and benthic habitat maps for shallow clear reefs based on improvements to the Allen Coral Atlas. These products are targeted at assisting in the planning and evaluation of coastal development in northern Australia, helping to ensure that sensitive high value habitats are identified and considered in development proposals. This project will use satellite imaging techniques to map this region based on methods consistent with existing reef mapping of the Great Barrier Reef, Torres Strait, and the Coral Sea. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Marine optimised satellite imagery for northern Australian seascape dataset (AIMS) [spatial dataset]\n • Reef boundary mapping for northern Australia seascape dataset (AIMS) [spatial dataset]\n • Improved shallow water habitat dataset (UQ) [spatial dataset]\n • Updated Benthic and Geomorphic Reference Data for Global Coral Reef Mapping (Western Australia, Timor Sea and Arafura Sea regions) dataset (UQ) [spatial dataset]\n • Technical report on Standard Operating Procedures for mapping reef boundaries (AIMS, UQ)\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub study - Protecting valuable shoreline mangroves of northern Australia. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe mass death (~80 km2) and dieback of shoreline mangroves around the Gulf of Carpentaria (GOC) and across northern Australia in 1982 and 2015 was a wake-up call to the vulnerability and immense importance of marine coastal ecosystems like mangroves. It is essential that we fully understand the circumstances surrounding such catastrophic events, the environmental triggers identified, and what we might do to restore the damage while also preventing future occurrences. In response to the 2015 mass dieback event (the world’s largest such recorded event), the NESP commissioned an Emerging Priority project that utilised aerial surveys to assess the extent of the dieback along the entire Gulf of Carpentaria coastline. It is proposed to resurvey GOC shorelines for their current condition whilst taking the opportunity further to devise a well-considered and fully costed rapid response plan that will include innovative preventative management outcomes for the longer-term sustainability of threatened but highly-valued coastal marine ecosystems of northern Australia. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • aerial survey imagery [imagery]\n • satellite imagery analysis [spatial dataset]\n • field & environmental surveys [tabular dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub project 'Supporting recovery and management of migratory shorebirds in Australia'. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nCoastal Australia is home to 37 regularly occurring migratory shorebird species, with many protected areas including Ramsar sites designated on the basis of shorebird populations. Many migratory shorebirds are declining rapidly, and hence the focus of conservation efforts at multiple levels of government in Australia and overseas. Excitingly, after decades of decline, many of Australia’s migratory shorebird populations are now showing improving trends (NESP MaC Project 1.21 - Australia’s Coastal Shorebirds: Trends and Prospects). However, we do not understand why the birds’ populations are stabilising, or how these gains can be converted into genuine population recovery to previous population levels. This project will combine analyses on more than a million observations of shorebirds banded in Australia with a comprehensive database of management actions to (i) create an annually updatable dashboard providing the key shorebird population parameters of reproductive output and survival, (ii) build a comprehensive database of conservation management actions for migratory shorebirds, indicating which actions are known to benefit reproductive output and survival, and (iii) create a shorebird management handbook that can be used by practitioners to guide action across Australia and around the East Asian – Australasian Flyway. Outputs will support DCCEEW’s international obligations in relation to Ramsar wetlands, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS), bilateral migratory bird agreements with Japan (JAMBA), China (CAMBA) and the Republic of Korea (ROKAMBA) as well as feed directly into developing the new incarnation of the Australian Government’s Wildlife Conservation Plan for Migratory Shorebirds. Results have a pathway for regional and local implementation through BirdLife Australia’s Migratory Shorebirds Conservation Action Plan.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Annually updateable dashboard providing estimates of reproductive output and survival\n • Searchable database of conservation management actions for migratory shorebirds\n • Shorebird habitat management handbook that can be used by practitioners\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "Uncovering the uncharted climate trajectories that could shape our future, equipping stakeholders with crucial information for managing climate risk.  \n\nCharting high-impact, lower-certainty climate scenarios \nConventional climate change projections are crucial tools for assessing future climate risks. However, these projections capture a limited range of possible climate futures. Many other plausible scenarios of unknown likelihood, such as greenhouse gas overshoot and stabilisation scenarios, and patterns of sea surface temperature changes in the tropical Pacific, are often not found in these datasets. This project aims to fill some of these critical gaps, offering a more comprehensive view of climate futures. By examining these “uncharted” futures, the research will allow risk managers a greater understanding of what could unfold under a broader range of climate conditions. This will allow them to start to consider what decisions and planning might address the level of risk identified.  \n\nTurning uncharted climate futures into actionable insights \nTo tackle these gaps, the project will apply innovative research methods and expert judgment, co-designing new approaches. The research will explore plausible but currently unaccounted-for scenarios, such as extreme climate trajectories and pattern changes. Research results will be turned into reports, briefings, and visual representations to help build a broader understanding of the risk management space of those previously uncharted scenarios. The project will collaborate closely with key stakeholders, including the Australian Climate Service, to ensure findings are translated into accessible, actionable information. By filling these gaps, the project aims to equip decision-makers with the tools necessary to make informed choices, ensuring that climate adaptation strategies are robust across a full spectrum of possible futures.",

  "description": "NESP 2 has introduced the notion of missions to ensure synergies and trade-offs across different environmental domains are recognised and linkages are being made. The mission leader group has been thinking about possible opportunities for a small number of sites that could provide a focus for Cross-Hub activity enable intensive interaction between NESP research topics and research teams. This was discussed with the Hub leadership group and several possible research locations have been suggested among them Kakadu National Park and the Swan Canning catchment and river system. Ideally, over time, we would employ the integrative approach in four areas representing a gradient from urban to remote.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale - \"Scoping Study: Supporting Regional Planning in Northern Australia\". \n\nDevelopment in northern Australia has had bi-partisan political support for many years and thus receives significant policy and funding profile.  However, the agenda is widely considered to have under-achieved against aspirations, becoming a heavily contested space with poor outcomes for development and environment.  Disputes over environmental issues are central to this contestation affecting development proponents, government agency decision-makers and affected communities.  This project aimed to make a positive contribution to easing (often known as de-risking) this contestation.  A key issue has been availability of agreed data/information/knowledge to all parties. This project planned to run this agenda in partnership with the Resilient Landscapes Hub and the CRC for Developing Northern Australia, thus covering terrestrial, marine and socio-economic issues in strategic partnership.  Given the many parties and wide range of issues involved, the project required extensive planning and consultation in the first year in order to develop a coherent research investment strategy for future years.\n\nOutputs\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "As coastal flood risks become more frequent in the future due to climate change, this research provides a fresh approach to making complex data and information more accessible and actionable \n\nUnderstanding coastal flood risks from storm tides and extreme events  \nSea-level rise is increasing the frequency of inundation of coastal places. Events that were once considered acute nuisances are now evolving into recurring issues. In addition to tidal flooding, the rare combination of a major storm surge and high tides, can exacerbate coastal flooding, and with sea level rise can lead to the possibility of major inundation and chronic impacts. This project aims to equip coastal managers, adaptation professionals, and decision-makers with data and information to improve understanding of coastal flood risks from storm tides and extreme events. We will develop case studies for better understanding and practical application to support community engagement and inform adaptation strategies. \n\nEmpowering decision-makers for a resilient future \nCo-developing user-friendly tools, such as flood likelihood overlays, will help stakeholders understand the frequency and likelihood of coastal flooding, enabling more informed decision-making for infrastructure planning and climate adaptation.  \n\nThe project will contribute to improving flood prediction models, including the development of new flood layers and inundation maps tailored to selected case study locations. By fostering collaboration with state governments, First Nations communities, and climate adaptation experts, the project will support the creation of actionable guidance to enhance resilience and facilitate better coastal planning for the future.

  "description": "Seagrasses provide resources and ecosystem services critical to the health of coastal ecosystems and human populations. They increase water clarity, stabilise sediments and reduce coastal erosion, sequester carbon, and provide habitat and food to marine animals, including commercially important fish and invertebrates. Across Australia, the loss of >275,000 ha of seagrass meadows and associated ecosystem services—valued at AU$ 5.3 billion—has contributed to the long-term degradation of estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems. Restoration of seagrass is critical for improving the health and function of these ecosystems and sustaining coastal communities and industries that depend on them, yet restoration projects to date typically occur at small scales, driven by local priorities and with variable success.\n\nThis project addressed this problem by bringing together scientists and key stakeholders to collate knowledge on seagrass ecology and restoration, and generated a framework to scaling-up restoration nationally. A national workshop with experts identified a shortlist of drivers key to restoration success, including sediment dynamics, microbial communities, hydrodynamics, and species interactions. It highlighted the importance of incorporating seagrass genetics and life histories into site and donor material selection to improve long-term resilience. New technologies such as eDNA, automation, and AI were also assessed for their potential to improve monitoring and reduce costs, while standardised methodologies and molecular tools were recommended to track microbial indicators and site suitability. A key insight from the workshop was the central role of sediment processes in feedback loops that determine seagrass health—providing a foundation for more effective, scalable restoration strategies.\n\nOn-ground case studies were conducted in Western Australia and New South Wales to test the proposed restoration framework in collaboration with Indigenous and community partners: sediment quality assessment and manipulation (Gamay Rangers, UNSW); seed and seedling capture using sediment-filled hessian tubes (Malgana Rangers, UWA); and large-scale seed collection for seed-based restoration through the 'Seeds for Snapper' initiative (OzFish and UWA). These trials demonstrated the effectiveness of community-led restoration and reinforced the potential of seed-based methods for scaling up seagrass recovery.",

They underpin coastal food-webs, fisheries, and a suite of other ecosystem services including nutrient and blue carbon cycling. Across much of the world, kelp forests are in decline and under threat from stressors including urbanisation, overgrazing, ocean warming, and marine heatwaves driven by climate change.\n\nAustralia’s giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*) forests are listed as a Threatened Ecological Community under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Habitat restoration is a potential tool for the conservation and management of giant kelp ecosystems. Given the direct impacts of climate change and ocean warming, there is growing recognition of the need for habitat restoration to be ‘future proofed’.\n\nFor restoration to be effective, the cause of habitat decline must be understood and overcome. This is problematic when climate change is driving habitat loss since it cannot be reversed or ameliorated prior to restoration. A previous NESP project led by this team ([NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub Project E7](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-e7-%E2%80%93-assessing-feasibility-restoring-giant-kelp-beds-eastern-tasmania.html)) identified warm-tolerant strains of giant kelp from remnant patches in eastern Tasmania, where the species has experienced precipitous declines due to ocean-warming. These strains have high potential to assist with ‘future-proofing’ kelp forest restoration, however it is still unclear what the physiological mechanisms are that provide their improved thermal tolerance. It is also unknown whether cross-breeding the identified warm-tolerant giant kelp strains will affect and potentially improve their thermal tolerance capacity.\n\nThis project explored the physiology of kelp thermal performance, specifically the mechanisms potentially responsible for the warm water tolerance identified in particular giant kelp strains. It confirmed the improved ability of the warm-tolerant strains to develop at stressful warm temperatures relative to normal giant kelp, and demonstrated for the first time that their improved thermal performance may extend to the development and fertilisation. The outcomes progress toward the identification of populations of Australian kelp that may be resilient to (or especially threatened by) ocean warming and climate change.",

  "description": "Plastic pollution is pervasive in coastal environments globally and in Australia. Due to their small size, microplastics (pieces <5mm) are readily ingested by marine organisms and potentially accumulate across food webs, raising concerns for biota, ecosystem services and human health. Yet, to define guidelines and support policy actions that curb microplastic pollution, managers and decision-makers lack clear, synthesised information on this multifaceted issue, including on occurrence, sources, and pathways of microplastics in coastal and marine environments.\n\nThis project synthesised current knowledge on microplastics in the coastal waters of South-Eastern Australia (South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales), identifying key gaps in data, monitoring, and risk assessment. A central output was a compiled database of existing microplastics studies across the study region. Through engagement with stakeholders from government, research, and industry, the project defined shared priorities and barriers to action. Three critical research needs were identified: (1) methodological harmonisation, (2) source and pathway identification, and (3) evidence of ecological risk. Together, the synthesis and stakeholder input set a clear direction for future coordinated research to enable evidence-based management of microplastic pollution across jurisdictions.\n\nThe work laid the foundation for the development of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for marine microplastics sampling, which was subsequently delivered through [NESP Marine and Coastal Hub Project 2.2 ](https://www.nespmarinecoastal.edu.au/project/2-2): chapter [*Marine sampling field manual for microplastics*](https://microplastics-field-manual.github.io) in [*Field Manuals for Marine Sampling to Monitor Australian Waters, Version 3*](https://marine-sampling-field-manual.github.io).",

  "description": "The southern right whale (*Eubalaena australis*) is listed as Endangered under the *Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999* (EPBC Act) and is subject to conservation listings in five Australian states due to severe population declines caused by historical whaling. The Southern Right Whale Conservation Management Plan 2011–2021 outlines the current status of, and threats to, the southern right whale in Australian waters and prioritises recovery actions during this period. The long-term vision for the recovery of this species in Australian waters is to increase the population size to a level that the conservation status improves, and the species no longer qualifies for listing as threatened under any of the EPBC Act listing criteria. The plan must be periodically updated to reflect new knowledge and prioritise the research needed to monitor population recovery and predict the impacts of threats such as climate change.\n\nAerial surveys of southern right whales have been conducted across the southern Australian coast from Perth (WA) to Ceduna (SA) since 1993, as part of a long-term program to monitor the recovery, and inform the Conservation Management Plan (2011-2021), for this Endangered species. In Australia’s south-east, there has been little sign of recovery in southern right whale numbers following intense commercial whaling. A working hypothesis assumes separation between the ‘western’ and ‘eastern’ populations, largely due to loss of ‘cultural memory’ of whales migrating to the eastern range breeding areas. Given the relative paucity of animals that visit the southern Australian coast in areas other than south-west Australia, the western population is considered to represent the majority of the ‘Australian’ southern right whale population. The count data from these aerial surveys provide data on population trend and estimates of population size for the ‘western’ population, and hence the majority of the Australian southern right whales. Associated photo-identification data provide life history information (such as calving intervals) and connectivity between the ‘western’ and ‘eastern’ populations and contribute to the national southern right whale photo-id database: the Australasian Right Whale Photo-Identification Catalogue (ARWPIC).\n\nThe 2020 aerial survey program recorded substantially lower numbers of whales than in the previous 13 years, and the lowest number of non-calving whales since the program started. This project conducted new aerial surveying in August 2021 to provide a relative estimate of annual population size for determining longer term population trends and contribute to determining if 2020 was an anomalous year or an indicator of some longer-term change to recent recovery rates and the female breeding cycle.",

  "description": "Climate change and population growth are accelerating the need for diverse solutions to coastal protection. Traditionally, shorelines are armoured with conventional \"hard\" or \"grey\" engineering structures such as seawalls which are non-adaptive and come with significant economic, environmental and social costs. While hard structures will continue to have a place in coastal protection, alternative methods that are more sustainable and climate-resilient should be more broadly adopted into the future where appropriate.\n\nLiving shorelines harness natural ecosystems to reduce coastal erosion and flooding and provide co-benefits such as carbon sequestration. They may consist of dunes, wetlands and biogenic reefs: either alone (‘soft approach’) or in combination with hard structures (‘hybrid approach’). To date, nature-based solutions have been underutilised in Australia, due at least in part to decision-makers needing clearer guidelines for when a soft, hybrid or hard coastal defence approach is most appropriate. This resulted in the publication of a foundational guide (led by Morris and Swearer and delivered under [ESCC Hub Project 5.9: Natural habitats for coastal protection and carbon sequestration](https://nespclimate.com.au/natural-habitats-for-coastal-protection-and-carbon-sequestration-project-5-9)) to inform the national use of nature-based methods for coastal hazard risk reduction. In the process of producing these guidelines, the lack of a national inventory of coastal protection projects already using nature-based methods was identified by end-users as a priority to enable their wider adoption as an adaptation strategy in Australia.\n\nThis project generated an online inventory of all current and planned on-ground actions by coastal land managers that have implemented a nature-based solution (NBS) to mitigate coastal hazards. From this, the [\"Living Shorelines Australia\"](https://livingshorelines.com.au) database was created. This inventory is the first step in identifying best practice, which will inform the future development of detailed technical design guidelines for implementing different nature-based methods in Australia.",

  "description": "Australia’s coastal floodplains and wetlands provide essential ecosystem services and have immense cultural value. They regulate water quality, moderate flood and storm damage, and provide habitat for marine life including commercial fish and shellfish species. These environments are threatened by accelerating rates of sea-level rise. A national approach is needed to monitor and assess the way coastal floodplains and wetlands are changing in response to sea level rise.\n\nA useful measure of resilience is the extent to which coastal wetland sediments can accrete vertically at a rate matching that of sea-level rise. Assessing the resilience, or vulnerability, of these environments requires measurements of rates of vertical accretion, subsidence and elevation gain across a range of coastal settings. The Surface Elevation Table-Marker Horizon (SET-MH) technique measures the vertical accretion of coastal wetland sediments. This enables assessment of whether wetlands are keeping pace with sea level rise (measured at tide gauges), or subsiding relative to local sea level rise and thus vulnerable to permanent inundation and loss.\n\nAustralia’s network of Surface Elevation Tables is one of the most extensive in the world, consisting of over 200 benchmark monitoring stations from Westernport Bay, Victoria to Darwin Harbour, NT. The network has developed largely without national coordination, and the data gathered have not been readily available to the research community or research users.\n\nThis project collated SET data on accretion, subsidence and elevation change in mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses and tidal freshwater forests, and provides an initial analysis of accretion and surface elevation trends. This information is vital to coastal risk assessment, estimating blue carbon sequestration, and modelling potential predicted changes in other ecosystem services.",

  "description": "Effective management of natural resources and biodiversity requires an integrated understanding of the complex relationships between people and nature. This project reviewed a range of socio-ecological frameworks to identify which system components influence environmental outcomes, and which are most relevant for policy design and behaviour change. A key point of difference from previous NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub projects was an additional theme on implementation pathways, enabling research to inform the full progression from policy to on-ground action.\n\nThrough a co-design process with stakeholders, the project identified priority social and economic research needs and assessed the availability of relevant datasets to meet them. A key outcome was the identification of three common decision contexts faced by managers—monitoring, trade-off analysis, and promoting behaviour change—and the matching of appropriate frameworks and data to each context. The findings highlight critical data gaps, while providing practical guidance on how existing information can be strategically used to inform management and policy decisions.",

  "description": "This project focuses on developing innovative tools using satellite imagery to map and monitor persistent pools (waterholes) within Australian rivers and floodplains. Persistent pools are vital water resources, especially under climate change and growing water use. They are crucial for ecosystems, providing habitats for species, sustaining ecological processes and serving as refuges during dry periods. The project will use satellite data from Landsat, Sentinel and Planetscope to map these pools, assess their dynamics, and predict future changes under various climate and water-use scenarios. The findings will support sustainable management strategies, including water allocation, climate adaptation and conservation efforts, with case studies in the Martuwarra Fitzroy River (WA), Gilbert River (Qld) and the Ovens River in Northern Victoria.\n\nPersistent pools are challenging to map due to their dynamic nature, shifting with changes in flow and precipitation. Current methods do not adequately capture these fluctuations, leading to potential underestimation of the area of persistent pools. The increasing demand for water resources, combined with climate change, underscores the need for better mapping and monitoring techniques. Remote sensing offers an efficient, cost-effective way to track these dynamic features across large areas, providing historical and real-time data to inform management decisions. This project aims to fill the gap in current methods by integrating data from multiple satellites and analysing the ecological and socio-cultural implications of pool dynamics.",

  "description": "To shift natural disaster management from ‘responding better’ to proactively preventing the worst outcomes, we will develop a culturally led framework for the identification and peer review of new, climate-targeted tools and strategies that will improve the resilience of our landscapes.\n\nPhase 1 of the project will focus on the development and refinement of a conceptual framework. The aim is to work with Traditional Owners – effectively and respectfully – to identify climate risks, impacts and observations on cultural and/or ecological values. We will then apply the Resist, Accept and Direct (RAD; Miller et al. 2007) approach to climate adaptation (if appropriate) to help develop the climate adaptation responses to specific landscape features or elements that are ecologically or culturally important. Traditional Owner led workshops will provide a culturally led priority list of issues of concern and gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed to respond to the likely impacts of climate change in a timely and effective way. The outputs of this phase (through reports and documents) will be a prioritised list of important cultural/ecological values that are at risk and in need of proactive strategies to build resilience across different ecosystem types. We will document how we use RAD to identify the type of climate adaptation response pathway that should be followed for each value and the concerns and gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. This will be used to frame the Phase 2 of the framework – ‘eco-thons’.\n\nPhase 2 of the conceptual framework is to take the prioritised list of values, and the kind of climate adaptation responses generated above to identify new ideas for solutions that could be refined and implemented as interventions on the ground. Each of the top 5 issues will be framed as a problem to workshop with specifically selected experts from a diversity of relevant fields in an eco-thon – a collaborative, environmentally focused, idea-generating workshop. The problem will be presented with the known gap and the parameters that must be met in order to be applicable on-ground. With representatives from First Nations people, scientists, engineers, conservators and farmers, these eco-thons will generate a broad range of potential management solutions and identify potential perverse outcomes. The output will be a peer-reviewed and prioritised (including benefits, costs, feasibility and risks) set of interventions ready to be implemented with some further testing of the strongest ideas, which is beyond the scope of this project. Traditional Owners will have right of veto of any idea through the process.\n\nPhase 3 of the project will review the conceptual framework and outline the lessons and recommendations of the process. This will be through evaluation by those who have participated in the first 2 phases of the project as well as independent evaluation by experts to make recommendations for refinement for future applications. The outcomes include application of this framework in real-world scenarios beyond this project.\n\nThis culturally led, evidence-based, transparent approach will raise awareness, enthusiasm and funding for the proactive measures that will be much needed in the coming years. The development and implementation of the identified tools and strategies are out of scope for this project.\n",

  "description": "The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) outlines key goals and targets that specifically acknowledge the importance of protecting, conserving and managing land and water effectively. While protected areas are well understood and studied, conserved and managed lands and their role in delivering environmental and social outcomes are not. To this end, ‘other effective area-based conservation measures’ (OECMs; termed ‘conserved areas’ in Target 3 of the GBF) will contribute alongside protected areas to meet area-based measures of 30% of land and sea by 2030. Similarly, managed areas which surround and connect protected and conserved areas are essential for meeting the broader goal that the integrity, connectivity and resilience of ecosystems are maintained and enhanced. Protected, conserved and managed areas will necessarily work in tandem to improve landscape-scale habitat quality and connectivity and, ultimately, overall persistence of biodiversity.\nThis project will review private-land conservation programs against the draft Australian OECM framework criteria to indicate the types of programs that are likely to qualify. Based on this review, programs that are near OECM standard but that fall short on key criteria, such as actively managing for biodiversity outcomes, will be considered for place-based research. Within programs, the research will design and deploy interventions to support landholders to manage their land consistent with OECM criteria and track the outcomes of this management over time to demonstrate enduring biodiversity outcomes. The research will demonstrate if the hypothesised benefits to both biodiversity and participants of these programs (e.g. increased nature connectedness) hold true. If our findings are positive, we expect these interventions could be added to private-land conservation programs in other jurisdictions.",

  "description": "Climate change and, in some cases, our mitigation and adaptation responses pose major risks to Australia’s biodiversity and landscapes. Yet it is biodiversity that provides the resilience (response diversity1) needed for nature, people and economies to cope, adapt and transform under a changing climate. It is a priority to enhance regional natural resource management (NRM) planning processes and capabilities to consider the risks and opportunities from large uncertain change and build investment cases to fund responses to these. By adapting and enhancing the ‘enabling resilience investment’ (ERI) approach in a pilot application with an NRM region in Australia, this project aims to build capabilities and coherence in biodiversity-adaptation assessment, planning and investment decision-making, and generate transferable principles and lessons that help scale these across NRM regions.",

  "description": "Surface groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in arid zones are critically important for biodiversity, and many are recognised by Traditional Owners as significant places in the cultural landscape. Increasing interest in developing the water resources in Australia’s arid zone has highlighted the need for a beter understanding of the ecology and socio-cultural values associated with GDEs and the potential risks from water extraction. This project will use Indigenous knowledge, remotely sensed data, hydrogeological information and ecological field surveys to improve methods for detecting and mapping GDEs, assessing risks of water extraction on flora, fauna and socio-cultural values, and monitoring changes in their extent and condition.\n",

  "description": "This research project aims to improve the understanding and strategic management of the combined impacts of fire and drought in the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area (GBM WHA). The project will be co-designed with Traditional Owners, researchers, land managers and other research users to synergise perspectives, methods and research needs for this Priority Place. Our research efforts will focus on understanding where and under what circumstances parts of the landscape are buffered from over-exposure to fire and drought (i.e. ‘refugia’) and will also evaluate the broader ecological consequences of specific fire-management actions that are designed to conserve endemic/iconic taxa. Improving knowledge of the landscape processes that give rise to plant refugia and how management actions impact ecological integrity will help to refine current management practices, build in future landscape resilience, and provide tools and insights for the adaptive management approaches that will be required to improve the condition of the GBM WHA now and into the future.",

  "description": "The project aims to identify the ecological processes that provide the conditions that create situations of greater safety or risk for mammalian wildlife within large, unfenced landscapes in different biomes across Australia. We will use elicitation, literature inspection and experimental translocations of a declining species, the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus), to identify and describe the intersection of habitat elements and ecological interactions (predation, competition, herbivory), both natural and human, that allow threatened wildlife species to persist in the landscape. We will experimentally test one ecologically based management lever, using removal of rabbit warrens to reduce predation risk from cats, and create safer patches in a large landscape, specifically for the western quoll (D. geoffroyi). We will produce a resource, accessible to diverse end-users on how to diagnose the problem and design solutions at local scale to create safer situations for wildlife within large, unfenced landscapes.",

  "description": "Australia faces many significant pressures that lead to the degradation of our ecosystems and the decline of our biodiversity, including our threatened flora and fauna. Appropriate monitoring approaches are required to provide baseline data and identify ongoing trends.\n\nMonitoring of environmental conditions and trends underpins policy and operational decision-making. Historically, monitoring required input by specialised personnel, making it costly and highly targeted.\n\nEmerging technologies are increasing opportunities for remote or passive monitoring and the recruitment of non-specialist input, including citizen science. However, the use of new technologies creates new challenges for the management of large volumes of monitoring data.\n\nThis project explores the application of new technologies to understand how to prioritise different monitoring tools and approaches, and integrate monitoring into broader management systems.

  "description": "When extreme rainfall combines with other hazards, such as strong winds, the impacts can be devastating. This project helps identify and map these high-impact events to support better planning and resilience. \n\nUnderstanding extreme rainfall and its impacts \nExtreme rainfall can have greater impacts when it is part of a compound event. When multiple heavy rainfall events occur in quick succession, river levels are higher; when extreme rainfall follows drought, it can be accompanied by debris flows, landslides and water quality impacts. And when extreme rain co-occurs with extreme wind, the risk of water ingress, treefalls and power interruptions are increased. Working with stakeholders, this project will build better indices of impactful compound extreme rainfall, to help understand when, where, and how they occur.\n\nThis project will work with stakeholders to identify the most critical extreme rainfall events and develop new ways to measure and analyse them. By focusing on real-world case studies, researchers will gain insights into the factors that make these events particularly damaging, such as their frequency, duration, and interactions with other hazards. \n\nDelivering tools for better risk assessment \nThrough case studies, the project will create innovative methods to define and map hazardous rainfall events, such as drought-breaking rains, clusters of extreme rainfall, and extreme wet/windy conditions. These new approaches will help decision makers better understand how these events are changing and where they are most likely to occur in the future. The project will also provide indices to assess high-impact rainfall hazards, improving climate risk assessments and emergency planning. Stakeholders, including state government agencies and private industry bodies, will be involved in co-designing the research, ensuring that the findings directly support decision making and preparedness efforts.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub study - Project 3.20– A National Approach to Indigenous Engagement in Australia’s Blue Carbon and Environmental Markets. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nBlue Carbon and Environmental markets, and their related environmental policy are rapidly evolving to meet National carbon reduction targets. In Australia, they’re emerging markets with great potential to improve carbon sequestration and restore biodiversity and cultural values. However, swift market growth infers the potential for perverse outcomes without proper regulation and processes implemented alongside. Corresponding regulation and processes are not yet in place to ensure Indigenous engagement is conducted in a legitimate, respectful, and empowering manner.  \n\nThe project proposes to coordinate a national Indigenous engagement approach for Blue Carbon and where appropriate include discussions on other Environmental market projects. This process will capture the wide-ranging rights and interests of Indigenous peoples and communities across jurisdictions and ensure empowerment in the Blue Carbon market. A key output from this research will be a document that outlines leading practice Indigenous engagement principles learned through a process of consultation with key Indigenous groups across Australia. It will be submitted to the Commonwealth government alongside proposed new Blue Carbon methods to enable efficient implementation that is ethical and in accord with leading practice principles of Indigenous engagement. The Blue Carbon market provides an opportunity for Indigenous community economic gain amidst complex legislation, tenure, resource ownership and co-benefits that haven’t been investigated in detail. Projects for the proposed Ungulate Method (Project 3.8) will occur on Aboriginal-owned land and mixed tenure where Indigenous people hold significant values and interests. Ensuring, Indigenous peoples rights, equity, and that principles of free, prior, and informed consent, are at the fore front of projects, leading practice Indigenous engagement is essential. The project notes that the legislative framework for the Blue Carbon market and how it relates to Indigenous peoples is different to other emerging environmental markets and it is likely to inherently limit the outcomes of this project.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Mapping tenure of Blue Carbon resources  [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub project Mapping Sea Country and investigating conservation and restoration opportunities along the Kakadu coast and Garig Gunak Barlu National Park. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThis project addresses the need for contemporary biodiversity and habitat data in the Garig Gunak Barlu National Park (Cobourg Peninsula) and coastal Kakadu National Park, essential for effective Sea Country planning and management. Successful co-management of protected areas requires strong support from the government to enable local communities to have autonomy in decision-making to benefit both the environment and livelihoods. The research focuses on a two-way knowledge transfer process to integrate Western science and Traditional Owners' knowledge to improve knowledge on the extent, condition, and biodiversity of coastal ecosystem habitats under current management and threats. This will empower Traditional Owners to make informed decisions on managing their coastal ecosystems, including restoration opportunities under emerging environmental markets, to improve the resilience of coastal communities and ecosystems under environmental changes while enhancing livelihoods. \n\nTo achieve this, researchers will collaborate with Traditional Owners to map coastal habitats, assess the biodiversity of coastal habitats, and evaluate environmental changes due to sea level rise and feral ungulate impacts. Outputs include co-authored publications, visually engaging materials, and a co-designed mapping project. Outcomes include better management of Kakadu National Park and Cobourg Peninsula by empowering Traditional Owners with enhanced knowledge that they can use to make on-ground decisions that benefit their communities and biodiversity conservation. This collaboration ensures that Traditional Owners' perspectives guide the management and preservation of culturally significant sites while exploring socio-economic opportunities in emerging environmental markets.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Biodiversity and habitat data for the Cobourg Peninsula and coastal Kakadu regions [field surveys & analysis]\n• Collaborative mapping with Traditional Owners\n• Assessment of potential risks to cultural values from sea-level rise and feral ungulates on coastal ecosystems\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub Project ' Innovations To Support Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish Control and the Resilience of the Great Barrier Reef'. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef (GBR) faces increasing threats from climate-induced mass bleaching, cyclones, and Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish (COTS). To maximise the GBR’s capacity to respond to these threats, it is vital to maintain coral cover and target management actions at the locations that best support the resilience of the GBR. Of the major threats to the GBR, only COTS can currently be directly managed. Australia’s COTS control program has already acted to reduce coral mortality at over 450 reefs. This project will develop innovations that increase the efficiency of COTS control, enabling protection of more reefs and more coral. \n\nTo maximise the resilience of the GBR, we must target protection to networks of reefs that can function together to rapidly recover from disturbance. This project will build our understanding of the factors and locations that support the resilience of the GBR. The research will be closely partnered to deliver directly to research-users in the COTS Control Program and the Reef Authority. The innovations developed will progress the adaptive management of the resilience of Australia’s marine ecosystems. \n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Statistical analysis data\n• Scooter Assisted Large Area Diver-based (SALAD) \n• Coral larval dispersal data\n• Thermal refugia and risk exposure maps\n• GBR ecological model COTS strategy outputs \n• Final technical report with analysed data and summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThe Gulf of Carpentaria Marine Park was only recently declared in 2013. The zoning plan for this marine park, which permits trawling within a specific trawling zone is due for renewal by 2028. There is a strong need to collect, analyse, synthesise and make publicly available information on the values and conditions of key habitats within the Marine Park, such as recently identified patch reefs and coral reefs, to contribute to this upcoming review of the management plan for this marine park.\nThe limited scientific information that is available on the values of this marine park is hard to access and much of it has not been analysed or written up. In addition, the Traditional Owners hold much valuable information about the ecological and cultural values that should inform future park management decisions. This project aims to gather, synthesise and report on existing scientific data and information about coral and patch reefs in the marine park.  This information will be presented to the Traditional Owners and other relevant stakeholders at community meetings or workshops.  Documenting cultural values of the reefs in this marine park is beyond the scope of the current project and would require considerable further engagement with Traditional Owners.  However, it is anticipated that presentation of existing scientific and biophysical data at community meetings will start this process.  We will produce visual (e.g. photos and videos) outputs that illustrate the values of these reefs, in order to better inform stakeholders involved in decisions about future park management.\n\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "Spotted Handfish (*Brachionichthys hirsutus*) were once common across the bays and estuaries of South-eastern Tasmania. By 1996, however, populations had declined and the species was listed as Critically Endangered under Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The species is relatively short-lived, (5–10 years) and matures at more than two years’ old. This leaves a short window for reproduction, which relies on egg masses laid on seafloor structures such as stalked ascidians. If spawning fails, population declines may occur rapidly. With no planktonic life stage to aid dispersal, and low adult dispersal, outside recruitment to re-establish collapsed populations is unlikely.\n\nAnalysis of 23 years of Spotted Handfish survey data (1997–2019) supported by previous NESP Marine Biodiversity Hub work [Project A10](https://www.nespmarine.edu.au/project/project-a10-conservation-handfish-and-their-habitat.html) helped develop a time-series of survey data, increasing biological understanding and contributing to effective management actions. This project recommenced surveys of multiple local populations, after a two-year gap, to ensure that the potential impacts of development of the Derwent estuary and surrounds handfish populations or their habitats can be detected. Included in the population surveying was identification of suitable locations to plant Artificial Spawning Habitats (ASH) where natural spawning structures have declined. This will continue to support the species' captive breeding program with industry and foster engagement with the indigenous and broader community through participation, talks, outreach, publications, and the National Handfish Recovery Team (NHRT).",

  "description": "The population of Southern Right Whales (SRW) in the Southern Hemisphere has been recovering slowly from near extinction due to its decimation from whaling before its ban in the mid-1970’s. The population that visits the Australian coast each year to breed is estimated to have increased by about 4–5% per year in the past two decades, bringing the total population to approximately 3,500 whales. As the population increases, the whales extend their breeding areas into previously occupied suitable habitat. As the species recovers, there is increasing evidence of expansion of aggregation areas. Consequently, there is a need to update known established aggregation areas and Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) and update relevant Marine Parks management plans based on new evidence.\n\nFlinders Bay and Geographe Bay off south-western Western Australia were likely to have been important calving areas before commercial whaling began. Much of this habitat is popular for recreational boating and other marine activities. This project collated and completed photo-ID matching of southern right whale images collected between 2010 to 2020 in the southwest of Australia, and uploaded these to the Australasian Right Whale Photo-Identification Catalogue (ARWPIC). The photo-ID matching outcomes provide evidence that Flinders Bay and Geographe Bay now fit the criteria to be recognised nationally as Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for Southern Right Whales.",

  "description": "Seabed and marine biodiversity data are time-consuming and costly to collect, so it is imperative that acquisition is focused on areas that align with end user priorities. The value that different stakeholders place on seabed and biodiversity data can be difficult to determine. Therefore, a shared process for identifying survey priorities is required to ensure the maximum shared benefit of future survey investment across research users, funding agencies, infrastructure providers, as well as the wider marine research community.\n\nThe project aimed to assist with the planning and prioritisation of marine surveys (both physical and biological) by scoping a prioritisation framework for marine surveys undertaking physical and biological seabed data collection in Australia. Focused workshops and targeted engagements with seabed mapping organisations were used to develop a standard set of metadata for agencies to define spatial Areas of Interest (AOI). The standard metadata were used in a prototype prioritisation framework that allows users to transparently and consistently rank and prioritise survey work or data delivery processes. The prioritisation is then based on rankings established by defined sets of criteria.\n\nA web-based AOI submission tool and mapping publication service was then developed for these defined areas as part of the AusSeabed Survey Coordination Tool. Adoption of this tool facilitates the development of an interim national areas of interest product to inform future survey planning. This product supports both the needs of Parks Australia's network Science Plans, and consideration of information needs for Indigenous Protected Areas within Sea Country.",

  "description": "Project summary\nFollowing discussions with Commonwealth and Regional research users, this project will include 4 major components:\n\n1 - Land managers from the Fitz-Stirling region in Western Australia require assistance to improve management of feral cats and red foxes.  The region has experienced researchers and managers, and collaboration with hub researchers will result in analysis and interpretation of existing data to inform future management. However, despite impressive local efforts to understand the ecology of invasive predators in the region, research users have identified opportunities for Hub research to build on existing knowledge to further mitigate the impacts of cats and red foxes on wildlife. Hub researchers will work with local research users to collect new data on target animals and incorporate these into practical recommendations for best-practice management (including monitoring) of feral cats and red foxes in the Fitz-Stirling Priority Place. This project will engage with and complement other work using existing cat-management data collected in the Fitz-Stirlings, and has been codesigned with end-users (WA DBCA and Bush Heritage).\n\n2 - The Commonwealth Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) and Saving Native Species (SNS) programs are exposed to significant risk from uncertainty related to the variable quality of feral cat and red fox monitoring program designs and the metrics they produce. This exemplifies an ongoing barrier to advancing feral cat and red fox management; ‘how do we monitor these species effectively?’ (this is a key issue in both the cat and fox threat abatement plans). This project will support NHT & SNS Service Providers and inform future management of the NHT program by investigating the statistical power of approved monitoring programs (Research questions: Can they detect what they want to detect; what is best practice monitoring of cats and foxes; how does this compare to what is currently being implemented at these sites; and is best practice monitoring cost effective?) and by operating three demonstration sites (Fitz-Stirlings, Kangaroo Island, Booderee NP) where ‘best practice’ monitoring will be implemented alongside existing monitoring programs, to contextualise typical monitoring outcomes (Research question: ‘What do monitoring metrics mean?’).  Guidance and training material on best practice monitoring and analysis will be a key output, alongside a shiny app that facilitates easy analysis of camera trap data using occupancy models. \n\n3 - Land managers on Kangaroo Island seek assistance in improving feral cat management in relation to leaky fences and understanding movements at low densities. An existing safe haven on Kangaroo Island is challenged with a leaky fence, providing the opportunity for Hub researchers to test the efficacy of sound-producing devices in keeping cats from breaching the fence. GPS telemetry will also improve our understanding of how cats traverse the landscape at low densities, which will assist with targeting management actions in these situations. \n\n4 - Synthesise our understanding of predator-prey interactions using the comprehensive datasets obtained from NESP projects in the Fitz-Stirlings, Uluru-Kata Tjuta, Kangaroo Island and Booderee National Park, as well as the information collected in sub-project 2. These sites have had extensive camera trapping occurring therein, which will yield information on presence and absence, that can be used in a multi-species occupancy modelling framework to determine the drivers of mesopredator interactions. This will provide evidence as to whether these interactions are driven by top-down or bottom-up factors. \n",

  "description": "Australia’s network of Commonwealth Marine Parks plays a central role in conserving marine biodiversity, supporting sustainable use, and protecting cultural and recreational values. With over 60 parks spanning diverse habitats - from shallow coastal areas to deep offshore canyons - effective and adaptive management depends on access to reliable, fit-for-purpose data and data products that reflect the condition of park values and the pressures acting upon them.\n\nThis project improved the capacity to assess the effectiveness of Australian Marine Park (AMP) management by identifying and evaluating priority data and data products required for characterising marine systems and management effectiveness. It worked closely with Parks Australia to assess the availability, quality, and delivery mechanisms of existing datasets, and determined whether these were operationally viable, maintainable over time, and aligned with FAIR data principles. Technical assessments considered consistency of formats, use of standardised vocabularies, as well as machine-readability and the use of national standards for data and collection methodologies.\n\nUsing available data, knowledge, and existing data infrastructure, the project developed methods for estimating the condition of AMP values (excluding cultural values) and for assessing management effectiveness. Recommendations were provided to improve the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of priority data products through national platforms.\n\nOutcomes of the project include a clearer understanding of existing data gaps and a practical foundation for improving future AMP assessments. Parks Australia was equipped with a structured assessment of current data suitability and availability, a demonstration of condition estimation methods, and strategic recommendations to enhance data delivery and alignment with park management cycles. This work directly contributes to the Marine and Coastal Hub’s Protected Place Management Initiative and supports national efforts to build integrated data systems for marine estate monitoring and reporting.",

  "description": "Recreational fishing is an important leisure activity in Australia that delivers important social and economic benefits to the community. As the largest and most widely dispersed natural resource-based recreational activity in the country, it is subject to management strategies including bag limits, quotas, and no-take zones. Given the prohibitive cost of deploying compliance officers to monitor Australia’s vast marine estate, strategies are needed to encourage voluntary compliance from fishers.\n\nThis project explored behavioural interventions to promote self-compliance among recreational fishers, focusing on no-take zones within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and two Commonwealth parks off Western Australia (Geographe and Two Rocks). The research distributed more than 800 online surveys, followed up by focus groups and analysis to examine how demographics, motivations and fishing patterns influence fishers' intentions to comply with zoning rules.\n\nSurvey insights were used to pilot a new targeted approach to awareness campaigns. Using behavioural segmentation, the project tailored messaging to specific audience types and tested these via GBRMPA social media channels. The project also examined perceptions of compliance visibility and found fishers were more likely to comply when uniformed officers were present and engaged directly at ramps or on water.\n\nThe project outcomes provide a foundation for evidence-based behavioural interventions and targeted communication campaigns. It delivers a proof of concept for scalable, audience-specific behaviour change approaches that can be refined, implemented, and evaluated in future research.",

  "description": "Australian sea lion populations have declined by more than 60% over the past four decades. Abundance and trends vary markedly across the species range, suggesting that localised risk profiles from threats - such as bycatch, marine pollution, and habitat degradation - vary at small spatial scales. Fine scale variation in habitat use is thought to underpin these differences, yet knowledge about Australian sea lion's dependency on key habitats and their vulnerability to human impacts is limited.\n\nThis project deployed compact animal-borne cameras with GPS and motion sensors on eight adult female sea lions at two key colonies: Seal Bay (Southern Kangaroo Island Marine Park) and Olive Island (Western Eyre Marine Park). The devices recorded nearly 80 hours of footage over 560 km of seabed, identifying six distinct benthic habitat types, including previously unmapped rocky reefs and kelp forests.\n\nThe footage was used to develop fine-scale habitat maps using machine learning models, providing a valuable baseline for assessing ecological value, foraging intensity, and the effectiveness of protected areas. This innovative approach complements traditional seafloor mapping and offers a scalable, cost-effective method for locating and monitoring critical habitats for endangered marine species.\n\nThe results directly inform recovery planning, fisheries management, marine park design, and the identification of Biologically Important Areas. Ongoing camera deployments at Seal Bay and new sites along the western Eyre Peninsula will improve understanding of sea lion colony-specific behaviours and contribute to long-term monitoring of habitat change, diet, and emerging threats.",

  "description": "This project aims to address two overarching research questions: how can First Nations Peoples knowledges be reflected within (or alongside) Ecosystem Accounts prepared following the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting—Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA)? and what are suitable methods for appropriately gathering and presenting First Nations Peoples’ knowledges in relation to SEEA EA?\nTo achieve the project aim, researchers will partner with two First Nations groups from contrasting contexts and environments (northern QLD savannah and southern WA coast). Together we will trial methods and prepare full sets of SEEA EA compliant accounts for each group. By co-designing methods and accounts presentation, the aim is for the accounts to provide information that is useful for the groups themselves in addition to providing useful information for other research users.\nBeyond accounts preparation, and incorporating existing Australian literature, the project will develop and test overarching learnings and recommendations that can inform future EA policy development within DCCEEW. Working closely with our First Nations partners, and testing outputs with a small number of First Nations people from other organisations, the project will seek to identify common themes across different First Nations groups, and assess the relevance of, and links between, national accounting information (such as NEAP) and accounts built upon First Nations knowledge and perspectives. The project is also linked with the Nature Repair Market team within DCCEEW and will exchange learnings and findings with those working in that space, thus seeking to promote complementarity between EA and Nature Repair Market developments.",

The government has committed to protecting 30% of land and sea by 2030. Alongside a more expanded and representative network, it is essential to ensure that the values of existing national parks are maintained. This requires strategic prioritisation of management activities, informed by rigorous monitoring and evaluation, targeted research on critical gaps in our knowledge about species and systems, and development and testing of new technologies and methods for monitoring and management. This project will address urgent questions for the management of Commonwealth national parks (which include World Heritage areas, Ramsar sites and priority places under the Australian Government’s Threatened species action plan 2022–2032 [TSAP]) and provide tools and case studies to benefit research users in other places. It has 3 components:\n• developing an integrated monitoring program for desert flora and fauna\n• developing acoustic monitoring methods to support species recovery and conservation\n• informing the strategic management direction of an island restoration program.\n",

  "description": "Advancing ACCESS—Australia’s climate and earth system modelling capabilities to provide world-class data and insights for research, policy, and international climate negotiations.  \n\nNext-generation climate modelling for science and policy\nAustralia’s Climate and Earth System Model (ACCESS) is a critical research tool tailored to Australian conditions, supporting climate policy and decision-making. This project will prepare new versions of the ACCESS Earth System Model and use these to perform climate simulations for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 7 (CMIP7)—a global initiative that informs international climate assessments, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 7th Assessment Report (AR7). \n\nBy developing an Australian-owned model, researchers can better capture local influences like the Southern Ocean’s role in future climate and carbon management and how Australia’s nutrient-limited soil impacts plant productivity and carbon uptake—factors often overlooked in international models. ACCESS ensures Australia has internationally credible tools for negotiations and policy decisions. The project, led by CSIRO in partnership with BoM, Monash University and the ACCESS-NRI, will provide researchers with cutting-edge climate data, supporting climate projections and the nation’s transition to net zero.",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - Project 3.9 - Establishing an Indigenous led approach to coordinated vertebrate pest management in northern Australia. For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nWild livestock (particularly pigs, buffalo and cattle) are one of the primary threats to coastal ecosystem values in northern Australia.  Wild livestock poses significant threats to cultural and livelihood values on Indigenous managed and owned lands and impact threatened species, water quality and other elements of biodiversity.  Recent research has highlighted the importance of feral animal impacts on coastal wetlands and ecosystems that have implications for greenhouse gas accounts and other important national environmental assets such as mangrove restoration, coral reefs, marine turtle nesting and wetlands values.   \nResearch is being done on feral animal impacts on several prominent and important values including carbon stocks, marine turtle depredation and sediment loads impacting coral reefs and seagrass.  This research has direct relevance to regulated and voluntary carbon and biodiversity markets. The development of new carbon abatement and sequestration methodologies and associated biodiversity protection markets could lead to economic opportunities for Indigenous owned and managed assets in northern Australia.  However, in the absence of Indigenous leadership in the research that underpins method development, there is a risk that the potential economic and social benefits of these new methods won’t be realised, will erode Indigenous rights and limit local participation in long term management and monitoring of threats.  \n\nThis project will support the development of Indigenous led methods for feral animal management with the aim of establishing methods that account for the values and cultural boundaries that underpin activities on the Indigenous estate.  We will do this research in partnership with Indigenous organisations that have long term feral animal management programs, developed with Traditional Owners and operating within the cultural and environmental boundaries of the homelands they manage.  \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • Map Indigenous land management tenure across northern Australia [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n • Research Paper [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nIn Australia, the dugong is protected under the EPBC Act 1999 as a listed migratory, and listed marine species, it is also a Matter of National Environmental Significance. The dugong is culturally significant to the coastal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of northern Australia and has a high biodiversity value. This project includes five activities that will contribute to addressing key knowledge gaps about the spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution, abundance, connectivity and health of dugong populations. The project is designed to inform management in several regions of high value habitat across northern Australia. Transversal to the activities described below is a strong partnership approach with Traditional Owners and members of the wider community. The project will be co-designed, co-produced and will co-deliver research and monitoring outputs. The studies will utilise and advance emerging technologies (e.g., aerial images collected from planes and drones, Artificial Intelligence, population genomics) with the ultimate goal of enhancing data quality, reducing research and monitoring costs, and increasing accessibility of monitoring tools to non-experts.\n\nActivity 1: Assessing trends in the distribution and abundance of dugongs during the transition to imagery surveys along the eastern coast of Queensland\nActivity 2: Assessing the trends in the distribution and abundance of dugongs during the transition to imagery survey in the Shark Bay and Ningaloo/Exmouth Gulf area\nActivity 3: Using population genomics approaches to identify populations and their level of connectivity across northern Australia\nActivity 4; Assessing the body size and body condition of dugongs using drone-based photogrammetry\nActivity 5: Developing community-led dugong monitoring with traditional owners in the Kimberley region.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Dugong sighting location and count data from observer aerial survey data [spatial dataset]\n• Imagery from aerial surveys and photogrammetry\n• Genomic sequencing data and tissue samples\n• Statistical code or script files\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n• Peer-reviewed open access publication",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nAboriginal ranger groups, Traditional Owners of the southern Gulf of Carpentaria (sGoC), scientists, Queensland, Northern Territory and Commonwealth government representatives will co-design and implement a program that enables a contemporary cross-border understanding of dugong populations and other marine megafauna. The dugong program comprises three parts: 1) Dugong population genetics, 2) a standardised aerial survey in the sGoC, and 3) Indigenous-led drone surveys of marine megafauna hotspots. The collaborative approach will enable contemporary data on abundance, distribution and genetic population structuring to inform local and regional conservation management actions. In combination with other NESP investments in Qld and WA, this program will have applied consistent approaches to dugong population assessment across three states.  This program directly responds to the national priorities of conserving, protecting and sustainably managing biodiversity through research and information management.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n • dugong distribution & abundance [spatial dataset]\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThere are many catchments in northern Australia where increased catchment development is proposed.  This is largely in the form of irrigation development, but also increased cattle stocking rates. Given the relatively low levels of such development in many catchments to date, there is a strong desire to maintain the integrity of coastal and marine receiving environments after the implementation of future developments. The baseline understanding of water quality in receiving marine environments and in the contributing catchments is very limited across much of northern Australia, making management and other development decisions very challenging.  However, there are examples of intensive grazing and irrigation developments in northern Australia, e.g. in the Lower Burdekin Delta, adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef coastline, where lessons can be learnt to fast-track understandings and management and set testable hypotheses about the potential impacts of development in other northern catchments. This project aims to take advantage of these existing examples to improve the quality of decision-making around the impact of terrestrial runoff on the marine environment, providing a template for decision-makers.  \n\nPlanned Outputs\n • River plume modelling [spatial dataset]\n • Estimated river plume sediment and Chlorophyll loads [modelling dataset]\n • Mangrove extents remote sensing [modelling dataset]\n • Primary production response to nutrients in estuaries [experimental dataset\n • Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"Scoping Study: New Approaches to Marine Monitoring\".\n\nAustralia’s has the third largest marine estate of any country in the world. Much of our marine and coastal resources are in offshore or sparsely populated areas meaning that our ability to monitor and assess our environmental resources and values is particularly challenging. To maximise our understanding of our marine and coastal environment, we need to take advantage of emerging technologies and approaches. This includes citizen science, community monitoring and Indigenous Rangers. In particular, it is expected that these groups will utilise the same technologies as mainstream science, thus these emerging technologies can bridge the gaps between science and community science to operate in unity. This project provides a series of workshops and engagement processes to best explore how to most effectively deploy technologies and community science programs to achieve maximum benefit and synergy in environmental monitoring.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Final report with analysis and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n\nThis record consists of 4 parts: Part A, Part B, Part C and Part D. The metadata record for this project is a summary of the entire project.\n\nPart A: Great Reef Census - a case study to integrate citizen science data into research output for marine habitat management\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nTo maximise our understanding of our marine and coastal environment, we need to take advantage of emerging technologies and approaches. This includes citizen science, community monitoring and Indigenous Rangers. Technology has greatly reduced the gap between mainstream science and community science to the point they may become almost identical in some integrated programs, especially when involving collection of in-field information. The challenge for science is to integrate with the vast opportunities afforded by this congruence.\nThe Great Reef Census (GRC) is an established citizen science innovation project, designed to pilot new ways of capturing reconnaissance citizen science data. By using citizen scientists to both collect and analyse reef images, as well as a team of professional scientists to ensure program rigour, the project is an innovative approach to assessing Great Barrier Reef health that complements and enhance existing monitoring programs.\n\nThe aim of this project is to demonstrate a citizen science approach can effectively fill gaps in knowledge when assessing marine habitats to improve management outcomes. As a case study, it will demonstrate how citizen science data can be integrated into the monitoring programs across Australia’s marine and coastal environments using new digital technology platforms. The project will also complement ongoing GBR-based research and provide critical knowledge gaps through end-user engagement with GBRMPA’s CoTS Control Program and Australia’s reporting on the health of the GBR.\n\nOur study will 1) scrutinise, validate and synthesize expert versus citizen scientist analyses of geo-referenced images collected during the Great Reef Census Year 1 field campaign and using the analysis platform, and 2) explore a re-structured online analysis platform that integrates machine learning and citizen science to extract more output from a growing image library collected during field efforts. The end product will provide a case-study evaluation of the benefits and capability of citizen-science programs as well as assisting decision-making capacity based on real-time broad spatial scale information on the Great Barrier Reef. The output will provide a demonstrated case study of meaningful citizen science application to assess marine habitats which can be applied more broadly to tropical marine habitats.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Synthesis R data package\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n\n\nPart B: NESP Marine and Coastal Hub scoping study: New approaches to monitoring.\n\nObservations of marine species have rapidly diversified over the last decade with increasing numbers of observations collected either through citizen science programs or opportunistically by citizens and then submitted into public databases. The expectation of citizens contributing those data is that the data is incorporated into formal analyses and utilised either for scientific or management purposes, with outcomes that improve current understanding and conservation of marine species. Further, there is increasing reliance on more informal and publicly driven approaches to the collection of observations given the costs of conducting formal surveys particularly if accessing remote regions, or if repetition of collection (across seasons or years) is needed.\n\nIntegrating opportunistic observations with more formally collected observations (e.g. those collected through robust survey designs), however, is not straightforward. Traditional approaches to estimating population abundance, changes in species assemblages, abundances and distributions through time require some understanding of the effort associated with those observations and how that effort is also distributed through time; information that is missing from opportunistic observations, given the nature of those observations. Further, many opportunistically collected datasets do not meet the statistical assumptions of many analytical approaches that might be applied to scientific datasets. As a result, opportunistic observations are underutilised at present and are largely only used qualitatively within research applications.\n\nTo take full advantage of this rapidly expanding resource and ensure that efforts associated with the collection of these observations are not wasted, methods that can integrate opportunistically collected data with scientific datasets are needed.\n\nThis project represents the first stage in developing integrative methods. It will bring together data holders, quantitative ecologists and statisticians to explore potential approaches that might be applied to facilitate the integration of opportunistic datasets with scientific datasets. In doing so, it will identify what datasets might be best suited to the development of integrative approaches (and what might not) and outline a pathway for developing those methods that could be implemented through a future project\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Workshop\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n\nPart C: Defining a pathway for the operational use of emerging technologies on country.\n\nMarine and coastal impacts in northern Australia occur overwhelmingly on Indigenous managed land. However, the collection, analysis and use of data to support adaptive management of the threats to these important ecosystems is dominated by external organisations. Existing monitoring solutions rely on trust in the training and expertise of the people collecting the data. The appropriate use of technology and associated training for Indigenous practitioners, coupled with software and hardware development, offers an alternative for Indigenous organisations and funders to deliver environmental, social and cultural impacts in northern Australia.\n\nNAILSMA and its partners have been engaged in activities that seek to develop ethical and inclusive technology solutions that enable Indigenous organisations new opportunities to maximize the participation and leadership in activities that support the management of threats to ecosystems across northern Australia.\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• Final technical report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]\n\nPart D: Barriers to using UAVs in conservation and environmental management.\n\nEnvironmental managers are embracing technology to assist with monitoring and evaluating coastal wetlands. Drones are being used routinely for fauna tracking and water sample collection; however, barriers in broader application still remain for adoption in environmental management. This research will survey conservation professionals about the barriers preventing drone adoption.\n\nTools available for conservation and environmental research are becoming more advanced and accessible to scientists, community and managers (Isosevic et al., 2021). The ability to mobilise science and technology has become increasingly more important for governments that are faced with balancing development and protection of the environment (Cash et al., 2003, Waltham and Sheaves, 2015). With the proliferation of UAV usage in research (Shahbazi et al., 2014, Hardin et al., 2019, Tmušić et al., 2020) and innovative ways in which they can be used to collect data, it is important to investigate whether these have a place in the conservation toolbox for conservation management. Managers need data on ecosystems to manage and protect them (Dale et al., 2019, Di Stefano, 2004), therefore the potential advantages of UAVs means that data collection using these tools could be more representative and cost-effective (Joyce et al., 2019). However, current management structures do not always leverage data or innovations effectively (Cash et al., 2003).\n\nPlanned Outputs\n• manuscript publication\n• summary information sheet",

  "description": "This record provides an overview of the NESP Marine and Coastal Hub small-scale study - \"National Assessment of Climate-Driven Species Redistribution using Citizen Science Data\". For specific data outputs from this project, please see child records associated with this metadata.\n\nThis project will develop a report card assessing Australian marine species to determine species that have undergone recent changes in distribution, either shifting into each state, or into new areas within states. This report card will draw upon citizen science databases (Redmap, iNaturalist, Reef Life Survey) and use a robust decision tree analysis to outline which species are shifting, and with what degree of certainty. Project objectives are to 1. draw upon citizen scientists to identify climate-driven changes within the Australian marine estate; and 2. communicate to and engage with the public on issues of climate change and biodiversity using their own citizen science information. The report card can be used to drive public interest in the NESP MAC Hub and in the status of biodiversity in Australia. \n\nOutputs\n • Summary data indicating the list of species that have undergone a range shift. This will record the old southern range, an updated old range based on new compiled historic data and the new range. [Spreadsheet dataset]\n • Species Assessment report with analysed data and a short summary of recommendations for policy makers of key findings [written]",
