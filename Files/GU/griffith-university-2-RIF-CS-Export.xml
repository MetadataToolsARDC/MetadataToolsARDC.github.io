      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Professor Mackay-Sim is a neuroscientist interested in using stem cells for two purposes: for understanding causes of neuropsychiatric diseases and for transplantation repair of the nervous system. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; He is using patient-derived stem cells to understand the cellular causes of two genetically complex diseases: schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, and two disease caused by mutations in single genes: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, and ataxia telangiectasia. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; He uses adult stem cells from the olfactory mucosa, the organ of smell in the nose and has established NeuroBank, a biobank of olfactory stem cells from more than 300 people with various neurological diseases. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; He is also using induced pluripotent stem cells generated by genetically engineering skin cells from patients with schizophrenia and Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Professor Mackay-Sim was scientific director of a clinical trial in which cells from the nose (called &amp;quot;olfactory ensheathing cells&amp;quot;) were transplanted into the injured spinal cord to test their safety in three paraplegic patients.

      <description type="brief">This project will use a collaborative learning model to build health promotion
capacity. The project brings together two innovative approaches to develop new
knowledge about how setting-based approaches to health can be implemented in
future. This approach could potentially address chronic disease at a national
and international level by promoting healthy communities that can effectively
manage chronic disease through collaborative learning and knowledge-building.
The project represents an important collaboration between a university and its
community with a view to improving health capacity.</description>

      <description type="brief">The olfactory (smell) system is a unique part of the nervous system because
nerve cells are generated throughout life. Understanding how the olfactory
system grows and regenerates may lead to therapeutic approaches to repair
other regions of the nervous system. This project will use high resolution
digital time-lapse imaging of living nerve cells and the specialised cells
called olfactory ensheathing cells to determine how the behaviour of these
cells can be manipulated to improve regeneration.</description>

      <description type="brief">Understanding how cells work is central to modern advances in biomedical
science, however many cellular processes are invisible to the researcher
because of a lack of appropriate tools. This proposal will apply modern
chemistry approaches to the design of new chemical tools for visualising
biomolecules within living cells and for investigating cell function. This
project brings together experts in chemistry, stem cells and malaria and has
applications for development of much needed new therapeutics. This research
will advance biomedical research and generate new discoveries for a
competitive advantage for Australian science, with potential economic return
for the nation.</description>

      <description type="brief">The Braided Channels creative research project is constructed from some seventy hours of oral history interviews with women of Australia&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;s Channel Country, together with archival film &amp;photographs, music and artwork. It explores the capacities of digital technologies to facilitate new versions of the &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;tilde;documentary project&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade; and uses visual metaphors to give local and personal stories a wider resonance. It is &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;tilde;relational art&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade; (Bourriaud 2002) where the artwork comprises all its associated events and elements and the cultural connections it facilitated. It is also an example of &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;tilde;shared history&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade; (Goodall 2002), bringing Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians into the same frame through &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;tilde;place&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;trade;. It includes the underlying Oral History Archive, the Channels of History social history exhibition, the Durham Downs broadcast documentary (in development) and research articles in the fields of historiography; museology; and documentary studies. The Heritage Trails Network funded the creation of the social history exhibition, Channels of History that started at the State Library of Queensland, then travelled to nine other venues between 2002-2005. The funding was critical to the creation of the final research outcome. Key contributors included Georgina Greenhill, David Huggett, Julie Hornsey, Erika Addis and Jonathan Richards.</description>

      <description type="brief">Suicide has been estimated to cost Australia over $460 million/year. Rural
suicide workers have mulitfaceted roles pivotal to their communities' social
well being, yet suffer professional isolation and inadequate access to
resources and expertise through geographic remoteness. Online technologies
potentially offer effective support mechanisms. This research will increase
fundamental knowledge by: * developing, implementing and rigorously evaluating
the effectiveness and transferability of an innovative online model for
professional support and expertise; and * systematically addressing the
complex ethical, professional and technical issues associated with using
online technology to assist suicide reduction.</description>

      <description type="brief">Stories from the Split formed one of two key elements in an ARC supported research project undertaken in conjunction with Professor Ross Fitzgerald and drawing on the visual/written history methodology explored in two earlier collaborations by the co-investigators.   



Stories from the Split : Memories, Confessions and Evaluations of a Political Struggle set out to document and analyse the events and issues surrounding the split in the Australian Labor Party in the 1950s. While this political and social upheaval had been covered in works primarily based on archival documents and journalistic sources, the approach of the project was grounded in substantial reflective oral history interviews and the gathering of  memorabilia and visual records from participants from a range of political institutions and perspectives. The key outcomes of the project were Professor Fitzgerald's  book length study The Pope's Battalions : Santamaria, Catholicism and the Labor Split and the oral history documentary Stories from the Split: the Struggle for the Souls of Australian Workers.  The primary aims of this project were to produce a comprehensive analytical written and audiovisual history of the clash of ideologies, individuals, organisations and events which culminated in 'the Split' in the Australian Labor Party in the 1950s; and to assess the continuing impacts of its legacy. This  contributed to the understanding of the process and outcome of these events and to wider debates concerning the roles and the effects of extra-parliamentary political organisations and the relations between Communism and Catholicism.</description>

      <description type="brief">Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised
by slowness of movement, muscle rigidity and tremor. It affects about 1% of
the population at age 50 and 10% over age 80. Symptoms are caused by low
levels of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement. The
symptoms increase in severity with time, leading to increasing difficulty in
walking, speaking, writing, swallowing and sleeping and increasing the
incidence of broken bones from falls. Parkinson's disease is incurable but the
symptoms can be controlled with medications that replace the lost dopamine.
Medications become less effective as the disease progresses and there is need
for new therapies. Worldwide the hunt is on to discover new cell
transplantation therapies to replace the dopamine in the brain and to prevent
degeneration of the still surviving dopamine cells. Although embryonic stem
cells might be useful for such therapies, they raise the risk of tumour
formation from the transplanted cells. This aim of this proposal is to test,
in parkinsonian rat, a therapy in which adult stem cells from the patient are
transplanted into their own brain to provide a new source of dopamine. We have
discovered a new and unique source of adult stem cells, the sense organ of
smell in the nose. Small samples can be taken through the nose and we can grow
these adult stem cells from people of all ages, including people with
Parkinson's disease. As adult stem cells they avoid the ethical issues
associated with embryonic stem cell transplantation and as cells from the same
patient, they are not rejected by the immune system. This is being tested in
principle by a world-first clinical trial in which we are taking another cell
type from the nose, growing it in the lab, and transplanting into the injured
spinal cord in a search for a cure for paraplegia. This project takes the
first steps to developing a new treatment for Parkinson's disease using a
patient's own adult stem cells.</description>

      <description type="brief">The project has a likelihood of reducing rates of fatal and non-fatal suicidal
behaviour by high-risk groups such as males aged 25 - 44, and growing
Australian populations such as the separated/divorced. The anticipated saving
of lives, injuries, and mental distress is expected to achieve substantial and
sustainable cutback in individual, corporate and public expenditure on mental
health, injury control and suicide prevention by government, community and
corporate agencies. Time and personnel resources utilised by the police,
ambulance, coroner, hospital, and insurance departments can be diverted from
highly preventable suicides to other areas.</description>

      <description type="brief">Increased knowledge of risk factors for suicide among mentally well males can
lead to better informed preventive health policies, earlier intervention and
community education. The tragic impacts of suicide lead to long-term societal
problems which result in disconnection and alienation, particularly for those
who are left behind; findings from this study will assist development of
initiatives aimed at increasing social connectedness and awareness. Also,
males compose the predominant workforce in Australia and the costs saved as a
result of effective prevention initiatives may be enormous, given that
economic costs to suicide are estimated at 900 million dollars annually.</description>

      <description type="brief">The Braided Channels creative research project is constructed from some seventy hours of oral history interviews with women of Australiaâ€™s Channel Country, together with archival film &amp;photographs, music and artwork. It explores the capacities of digital technologies to facilitate new versions of the â€˜documentary projectâ€™ and uses visual metaphors to give local and personal stories a wider resonance. It is â€˜relational artâ€™ (Bourriaud 2002) where the artwork comprises all its associated events and elements and the cultural connections it facilitated. It is also an example of â€˜shared historyâ€™ (Goodall 2002), bringing Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians into the same frame through â€˜placeâ€™. It includes the underlying Oral History Archive, the Channels of History social history exhibition, the Durham Downs broadcast documentary (in development) and research articles in the fields of historiography; museology; and documentary studies.



The Centenary of Federation funding supported the creation and digitisation of the oral history archive. It includes the digitisation of 27 interviews that were filmed and sound recorded across outback and rural Queensland, Brisbane and Sydney.



Key contributors to the project include Georgina Greenhill, David Huggett, Julie Hornsey, Erika Addis, Jonathan Richards and Ashleigh Harding.</description>

      <description type="brief">This project focuses on the capture of high resolution data from a sensor network comprised of 320 remote nodes (data loggers) situated between the Sunshine and Gold Coasts in the South East Queensland Corridor.  The loggers are configured to batch scheduled readings in a weekly upload via email. This project replaced standard council water meters with "Smart Meters" that can record very small volumes of water at 5 second intervals. This data will be stored in state-of-the-art data loggers and sent, via email, to a remote computer for analysis.  End use data analysis will be conducted using a special programme that can identify water use patterns of specific end uses such as toilets, dishwashers and showers. 



The meters have the capacity to deliver high resolution end use data that will provide information to planners and water engineers to understand why, how and when water is being utilised. This will facilitate the proactive management of water resources.</description>

        <namePart type="title">Griffith Centre for Cultural Research</namePart>
      </name>
      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Griffith Centre for Cultural Research is an interdisciplinary research centre. With members across humanities, creative arts and life sciences, its central brief is to encourage greater collaboration between these areas, while articulating with contemporary debates in public culture. As part of this agenda, the centre regularly hosts seminars by visiting scholars, public lectures and other public events.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;About the centre&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Centre’s research is broadly arranged around four strategic research programs:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Culture, identity and lifestyle&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Engaging audiences&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Material and textual narratives&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Transnational histories.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The purpose of these programs is to facilitate the effective channelling of the Centre membership’s multi-disciplinary research expertise into a series of targeted research projects clustered under the program themes. Although each program reflects to some extent discrete disciplinary interests within the centre, the aim is not to confine the work of any given Centre member to one program, but rather to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration between Centre members and also with members of other Centres within the AEL group. International collaboration is also becoming an increasingly more significant aspect of Centre research. All four Centre research programs have generated projects, seminars and other forms of academic exchange involving overseas collaborators.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Culture, identity and lifestyle&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research program brings together on-going research by cultural sociologists in the Centre focusing on aspects of cultural consumption and cultural practice in contemporary urban and regional settings in local and global contexts. A number of projects are currently in progress, including popular music and cultural memory, street music and the urban soundscape, festivals and public culture, youth culture and mediation, and sexualities and subcultures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Engaging audiences&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research program consolidates a key strength of the Centre in the area of media and journalism studies. Current and on-going projects include research on ethnic minorities use of community-based talk back radio, indigenous media across Australia, the role of the media in the representation of terrorism and national security. Following a highly successful visit to the College of Communication at the National Cheng Chi University, Taiwan, projects around community journalism and the use of digital media in disaster relief are currently being planned with NCCU colleagues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Material and textual narratives&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research program combines Centre research strengths in areas of cultural sociology, history, literature and journalism to examine the aspects of material and textual culture and their significance in everyday life. Current projects cover: the history of the book; reading practices in Australian society; the ritual significance of material objects in death and remembering.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Transnational histories&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research program combines the specialisms of Centre members working in the field of historical studies. Fields of expertise include indigenous history (in Australian, pan-Pacific and global contexts), studies of Victorian society, indigenous rock art, and local / Queensland studies. The rationale of the trans-national histories program is provide a forum for understanding how each of these areas of historical interest combine to provide new insights into the relationship between the local and the global in historical and contemporary cultural contexts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Centre encourages partnerships with cultural institutions, public agencies and local government and community and corporate organisations. Through a program of publication, public lectures, workshops and symposia, we aim to make the processes and outcomes of Centre-based research available to public audiences as well as scholarly communities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Research Professor, Griffith Institute for Educational Research Senior Academic Fellow, Griffith Institute for Higher Education (Higher Degree Research Education) Professor Parlo Singh’s research work focuses on issues of educational equity and social justice. Specifically she is interested in research partnership work that assists students from disadvantaged communities gain access to complex forms of knowledge. This research has involved working with primary and secondary schools in Queensland, Australia, as well as work in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia through funded research projects. Issues of educational inequity have inevitably dealt with the dynamics of social class, gender, and cultural identity, and theorisations of policy, curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. Of particular significance is work that challenges the re-production of social inequity via schooling systems through complex sociological theorising. Parlo has been a member of the international symposium extending the sociology of Basil Bernstein, particularly his theorisations of curriculum and pedagogy, and strategies for disrupting educational inequality. Parlo migrated at a young age to Australia from India and speaks Punjabi, which was her first language. Her research work has focused on the educational experiences of Asian international students, as well as the work of Australian teachers working offshore in Asia-Pacific countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, China and Papua New Guinea. Parlo has held numerous leadership positions in the university sector. She was the inaugural Director of the Research Centre for Language, Literacy and Diversity (2000-2003), Faculty of Education, QUT. She has also held the position of Head of School, Education and Professional Studies, Faculty of Education, Gold Coast campus (2006-2009). In this role she reinvigorated the Teacher Education Industry Advisory group in order to develop productive university-schools partnerships to develop innovative practice-oriented teacher education programs and effective educational research collaborations. From 2009-2012, Parlo held the position of Dean, Griffith Graduate Research School which involved strategic leadership in the area of higher degree research (HDR) across all academic disciplines and all campuses of Griffith University. In this role, Parlo's leadership was central  to establishing the Board of Graduate of Research and Chairing this university committee to ensure strategic HDR policy renewal and implementation. Professor Singh is the recipient of numerous excellence in teaching awards, including the 2009, Australian College of Educators, National Fellow Award for higher degree research education and training.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;DEMs are sometimes referred to as digital terrain models (DTM), a general term applied to models of elevation, slope, aspect or other terrain attributes. DEMs are built from datasets of varying type, scale and accuracy. They may be made from ground surveyed or photogrammetrically obtained heights, existing topographic maps usually originally obtained from analogue photogrammetry, or using radar or laser altimetry data from aircraft or satellites.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A combination of soils description, laboratory testing, elevation and geology data, and API (airphoto interpretation) was used to construct the map. This mapping is at a nominal scale of 1:25,000 and is restricted to coastal areas below 5m AHD. However, the effective scale of each map polygon varies based on the number of soil description sites within it. This map may be used for strategic land use planning. It is also appropriate for a very general preliminary assessment of acid sulfate hazard at property scale. However, it is not sufficiently detailed for intensive development planning.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

        Freshwater fish stocking in Queensland is the process of releasing young fish (fingerlings) into dams, weirs and rivers to enhance and maintain fisheries, provide mosquito control and assist threatened fish species to recover.&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;Fish are stocked in Queensland public waters by approximately 70 community-based fish stocking groups that have stocking permits. The Stocked Impoundment Permit (SIP) scheme provides funding for stocking groups at 32 dams in Queensland. Fish stocking groups also raise funds in the community to stock non-SIP dams, weirs and rivers.&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;Impounded waters such as dams need to be continually restocked because, in most circumstances, stocked species will not reproduce there. Most of the popular dam fisheries in Queensland are stocked each year with fingerlings to ensure the fishery remains successful into the future.

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This data set was created as a consequence of a larger project involving the capturing of all gauging station catchments in Queensland, undertaken at RSK, a business group of the department. The polygons were constructed by: - Using the existing major and minor river basins as an external framework. - Creating a clear overlay matching every 1:100 000 topographical map in Queensland. - The clear overlay had all 1:250 000 river basin boundaries, the major and minor river basins as well as the corner points for each map sheet.plotted on it. - Using these 1:250 000 basin boundaries, the major and minor river basins and the topography from the 1: 100 000 topo maps as a guide, the Sub-Basin Areas were determined and traced on to the clear overlay. - These basins were then digitised and stored in an ArcInfo coverage. RMS errors not &amp;gt; than 0.005. - These arcs were then tagged as ` Sub-Basinbdy `- Sub-Basin Areas - Queensland. - Regions were created from the resulting polygons.- Attributes pertaining to these regions are: Sub_Name; Sub_Number (AWRC). Its original purpose was to implant some location identifier into the numbering system of bores and gauging stations. For example all bore numbers were prefixed with a four-digit number. The first three were used to locate the bore into a specific major river basin. The fourth digit was used to locate the bore into a subdivision of that major river basin as shown in the Sub-Basin Areas - Queensland coverage. This coverage is now only used as a means of numbering bores and gauging stations. Its capture scale is 1:100 000. Legislation: Water Act 2000, Division.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

In addition, waterways have been colour-coded along their length to show the risk of adverse impact from in-stream barriers on fish movement and whether a waterway barrier works can potentially proceed under the relevant Fisheries Queensland self-assessable code or whether the works will require a development approval.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The definition of 'waterway' under the Fisheries Act is broad and a Queensland-wide spatial data layer has been developed to better delineate this. Waterway barrier works are regulated under the Fisheries Act 1994 and the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 when barriers to fish movement, including partial barriers, are installed across waterways.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

Data preparation standards for data being entered into the Groundwater Database have been in place since at least 1982. These standards are periodically reviewed and enhanced. Data has been manually entered into the database by many staff and imported from other data sources over time and not all data will adhere to these standards. Problems may be identified and corrected through data validation processes. Standards are used to enhance consistency of data. Automatic validation of codes and allowable number ranges occurs when data is entered. Spelling errors may occur through data entry. Data entered from a drilling log is also reliant on the accuracy of the data provided on the log. The data in the Groundwater Database has been collected over many years from many different sources including logs from water bore drillers and groundwater investigations and surveys performed by the Queensland Government. Water level and water quality data is collected from bores on the Queensland Government groundwater monitoring network. The quality or bore locations and other data are variable and the bores construction and other bore properties may have changed over time from that recorded.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

        Permanent measurement stations have been established at both nodes to provide continuous water quality and flow data.

      <description type="brief">
        In the SEQ Peri-urban Supersites located on the Logan and Albert River, high-frequency biogeochemical and ecological studies are underway to help scientists understand why they contribute such high loads of nitrogen and sediment into Moreton Bay.  These measurements will help researchers to quantify land-use change.
      </description>
      <description type="note">
        The stations consist of physico-chemical sensors to measure temperature, pH (degree of acidity or alkalinity), Eh (the redox, or reduction-oxidation, character of the water), conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll, blue green algae, CDOM and nitrate; and a velocity Doppler to measure river flow and height.

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The dataset is a product of the Queensland Land Use Mapping Program (QLUMP) and was produced by the Queensland Government. The dataset comprises an ESRI vector geodatabase at a nominal scale of 1:50,000. The layer is a polygon dataset with each class having attributes describing land use. Land use is classified according to the Australian Land Use and Management Classification (ALUMC) Version 7, May 2010. Five primary classes are identified in order of increasing levels of intervention or potential impact on the natural landscape. Water is included separately as a sixth primary class. Under the three-level hierarchical structure, the minimum attribution level for land use mapping in Queensland is secondary land use. Primary and secondary levels relate to land use (i.e. the principal use of the land in terms of the objectives of the land manager). The tertiary level includes data on commodities or vegetation, (e.g. crops such as cereals and oil seeds). Where required and possible, attribution is performed to tertiary level. QLUMP maps the land use classes of sugar and cotton to tertiary level. A representation is available for users to apply a symbology to the land use data, by secondary ALUMC. The areas mapped as sugar include features such as tracks and drainage lines which are too small to be mapped separately at the scale of 1:50,000.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This dataset is a digital land use map of the Logan Albert Catchment, Queensland. As nearly as possible it shows land use in 2012. Updated land use datasets for 1999 and 2006, and land use change layers for 1999 - 2012, 1999 - 2006 and 2006 - 2012 are also available with this data package.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The coastal bioregions comprise: (1) Brigalow Belt Bioregion sub-regions Townsville Plains (sub-region 11.1), Bogie River Hills (sub-region 11.2), and Marlborough Plains (sub-region 11.14), (2) Central Queensland Coast Bioregion, (3) Cape York Peninsula Bioregion sub-region Starke Coastal Lowlands (sub-region 3.2), (4) Einasleigh Uplands Bioregion sub-region Hodgkinson Basin, (5) Wet Tropics Bioregion, (6) South East Queensland Bioregion. It is derived from the bioregions of Queensland, version 5.0 dataset. Queensland has been divided into 13 bioregions defined in the report 'The Conservation Status of Queensland's Bioregional Ecosystems' (Sattler and Williams 1999). Bioregions represent broad landscape patterns that are the result of the interplay between factors including geology, climate and biota.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

One of the purposes of the Vegetation Management Act 1999 is to regulate vegetation clearing in a way that prevents the loss of biodiversity. To fulfil this obligation, Vegetation Management within Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNRM) uses the essential habitat map as a tool when assessing vegetation clearing applications to assist in determining whether the vegetation is habitat for Endangered or Vulnerable species.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

The complete set of GDE datasets is listed below. Information about the location and extent of known and potential GDEs was sourced from expert knowledge, literature and existing datasets. 1. Surface expression GDE points 2. Surface expression GDE lines 3. Surface expression GDE areas 4. Terrestrial GDE areas 5. Subterranean GDE areas. As the different types of GDEs represent different overlapping layers or cross-sections of the landscape, it is recommended that the datasets be mapped in the order of listing shown above (i.e. surface expression GDE points on top) to maintain logical consistency and assist visualisation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

Surface expression GDE area features include wetlands and regional ecosystems that have some surface groundwater dependency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New and existing data from 33 freshwater species (23 fishes and 10 crustaceans) were combined, and both standard single-species analyses (haplotype networks, genetic distances, ΦST) and multispecies methods (hierarchical ABC) were carried out for 1814 sequences from eight basins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many single-species freshwater phylogeographic studies have been carried out in south-east Queensland, however comparative phylogeography requires multiple lines of evidence to infer deep, significant relationships between landscape and biota. The present study aimed to test conclusions resulting from single taxon studies in a multispecies comparative framework: (1) how influential are river basins in the genetic structure of freshwater species; (2) are there biogeographic frontiers between groups of basins; and (3) could deep intraspecific lineages be explained by a single event?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

A network of acoustic receivers recorded and stored the date and time of individual animals, which was used to monitor their movements. The majority of the receivers were based in the Logan and Albert River system, but a smaller number were also deployed within Moreton Bay.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Information was collected on the movement patterns of fish and elasmobranchs in Logan River and Albert River as well as southern Moreton Bay, using an underwater sensor array. Data was collected to assess the long term movement of fish and sharks in the Logan and Albert River with a primary focus on the influence of water flows. Project objectives included: - Establish an array of acoustic receivers in the Logan and Albert Rivers. - Determine the spatial and temporal habitat usage and movement of teleosts and elasmobranchs as important predatory species. - Use spatial and temporal habitat usage and movement patterns to assess the influence of water quality, urbanisation and freshwater flows.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

        <namePart>Australia - Assessment of River Condition (Reach) - 2001</namePart>
      </name>
      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The river basins assessed include areas that contain intensive land use and selected areas of non-intensive land use such as part of the Northern Territory and the western division of the Murray-Darling Basin. Whole river basins were used so that processes such as hydrology and sediment and nutrient movement could be modelled and balanced over entire catchments.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Assessment of River Condition is the first attempt to report on river condition for key river basins across Australia. The integrated assessment provides a basin-wide context and a framework within which decisions and river management priorities can be considered. The assessment incorporates a range of attributes that are considered to indicate key ecological processes at the river reach and basin levels.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
      <description type="note">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The two indices developed are an Aquatic Biota Index using macroinvertebrates, and an Environment Index with four sub-indices: catchment disturbance; hydrological disturbance; habitat; and nutrient and suspended sediment load. A range of data types and approaches were used including direct measurements and modelling of nutrient and sediment loads.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

        Determination of fire events&amp;#xA;Data on the location, area and date of fire events between 2000 and 2006 was obtained from Brisbane City Council. These maps were digitised using ESRI, ArcGIS software. The information from Brisbane City Council about locations of fire in Karawatha was used to create polygons in the GIS of areas of fire. The plot grid of Karawatha PPBio was then overlayed to give the plots that had been exposed to fire in the past. Data about fire history was available for years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. Combined spatial data was used to calculate fire frequency and time since last fire event for each plot.

        Bird surveys&amp;#xA;Three circular bird survey points (BSP) (30m radius) each covering 0.28ha, (0.84ha total / plot), were positioned along the midline at each plot. The spatial positioning of BSPs along the midline was at, 0-60 meters, 95-155 meters and 190-250 meters.Each BSP was surveyed by a single observer to avoid multiple observer biases. Counts lasted a total of eight minutes, initiated after a two minute settling period, using sightings only for abundance estimates. A two minute settling period is used to alleviate disturbance effects of the observer walking to the centre of each BSP with all sightings within this period considered to be opportunistic recordings that will be used for matching birds to habitats. Replicated surveys of plots throughout Karawatha Forest Park were made on five separate occasions during the sample period. All surveys were conducted during the early morning beginning 30 minutes after sunrise continuing through for 3-4 hours. No surveys were carried out if cloud cover exceeded the ratio of 3:8 which creates difficulty in identifying canopy species due to effect of contrasting light. This rule also excludes the possibility of surveying in rain. High wind velocity also reduces activity therefore no counts were conducted above 15 knots. All birds seen within each BSP were identified and recorded with an estimation of the height of the bird within the vertical stratum of the forest. Birds heard during surveys were recorded opportunistically. All birds viewed flying directly above the canopy was not included as present within the forest. Aerial sallying insectivores flying at a height less than 20 meters above the canopy layer were included.

        The methods used were: expert ornithologist, citizen scientists and acoustic recorders. All three methods were used at each plot and the sampling methods were performed concurrently. Each plot follows the elevation contour and is 250 m long x 80 m wide. The starting point of plots are spaced 500 m apart. Surveys were undertaken between May and August 2012. Surveys conducted by the ornithologist and citizen scientists were 20 min long and took place within the first three hours of sunrise. Each plot was surveyed twice by the ornithologist and the citizen scientists (n = 128). A total of eight citizen observers were used in this study, with each observer surveying a minimum of five plots. Multiple observers were present on each plot at any one time to increase safety, but were spaced temporally so as to reduce the influence of the other observer(s). The acoustic recorders were developed by Dr Paul Roe and Jason Wimmer from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). The recorders comprise of an Olympus DM-420 digital voice recorder (recording at 44.1 kHz 128 kbps, and between 40-17,000 Hz) with an external battery power source (Duracell D-cell batteries) enclosed within a waterproof, lockable casing, with an external stereo-microphone array. All recordings were in mp3 format. At each plot one recorder was placed at the base of the closest small tree 5m to the left-hand or right-hand side of the 125m mark of the transect midline. The recorder was buried in a shallow hole (no deeper than 25cm) and covered with dirt and surrounding leaf litter for camouflage to prevent tampering/theft, with the stereo microphones attached to the box being secured to the adjacent tree and elevated from the ground. During each two week period the recorders were set to record every morning for two hours, with all recordings being within the period till three hours after dawn. Twenty-eight hours of recordings were obtained for each plot (896 hours total for the study).

        Canopy cover was measured using photographs taken at 50 m intervals along the 250 m mid-line of the plot. Ground cover was measured using the point-intercept method at 2 m intervals along the mid-line.Determination of canopy coverCanopy cover can be defined as the extent of coverage of the forest floor by the vertical projection of tree crowns (Jennings et al., 1999). The percentage canopy cover was measured along a 250m transect located 5m to the left- hand side and parallel to the plot midline (ie. the same transect that lizard surveys are conducted on; from now on, referred to as the “vegetation transect”). A measure of canopy cover or CGF (Canopy Gap Fraction) was obtained using a modified method by Zancola et al. (2000). A Seimax Super 0.35X semi fisheye lens (MVC-FD73) was used with a Sony Digital “Mavica” camera to photograph the canopy every 50m, therefore giving six measures for each plot. The photographs were converted into black and white images using Paintshop Pro software, and then opened in Image Pro where the numbers of pixels were counted. An estimate of canopy cover for each image was reached by dividing the total number of pixels by the number of black pixels. Percentage canopy cover for the entire plot was then calculated by averaging the six estimates.References:Jennings, S.B; Brown, N.D. and Sheill, D. (1999). Assessing forest canopies and understorey illumination: canopy closure, canopy cover and other measures. Forestry. 72: 59-73Zancola, B. J., Wild, C.H. and Hero J.M. (2000). Inhibition of Ageratina riparia (Asteraceae) by native Australian Flora and fauna. Austral Ecology 25: 563-569.Determination of percentage ground coverGround substrate refers to shrubs (up to 2m), leaf litter, rock, bare ground, grasses, coarse woody debris (CWD) and herbs. The percentage cover of all ground substrates was calculated using the point- transect method (referred to as the “line- point transect method” in Bonham (1989)). A wooden dowel, 2m in length and 9.5mm diameter was used to probe the ground at 2m intervals along the 250m vegetation transect (a total of 125 points per plot) and all substrates that the pole intercepted were recorded. This included termite mounds and trees however these variables were removed from any analyses because they were recorded in very low numbers. Percentage cover of total ground substrates and the percentage cover of each individual component (eg. rock, shrub etc.), always summed to 100%. The frequency of touches for each component was also recorded.References:Bonham, C.D. (1989). Measurements for Terrestrial Vegetation. John Wiley and Sons: New York, New York, USA.Determination of leaf litter depthLeaf litter depth was measured by using the same wooden dowel as above, which had markings in 1cm increments from the base. For the purpose of this study, leaf litter depth can be defined as the vertical distance from the highest dead particle in contact with the wooden dowel, to the bottom of the litter layer (Brown and Nelson, 1993). Litter depth measurements were taken every 2m along the 250m vegetation transect. A total of 125 measures per plot were recorded and these were averaged to obtain an estimate of litter depth for the plot.Reference:Brown, G.W. and Nelson, J.L. (1993).

        Scat survey&amp;#xA;The Spot Assessment Technique (SAT) was applied at a distance of 125m on each of the 33 Karawatha plots. The tree with DBH greater than 10cm closest to the transect midpoint (at 125m) was used as the focal tree. Once the focal tree was located, observers completed the Spot Assessment Technique by searching for koalascats around the base of the tree for approximately two minutes. An additional 29 surrounding trees greater than 10cm DBH were also sampled in a radius around the focal tree. A tree was defined as a woody plant species with a DBH greater than 10 cm excluding cycads, palms and grass-trees. The two observers searched for koala scats within a 1m radius at the base of each tree for a maximum of 2 person minutes per tree, or until scats were detected. The trees were identified and DBH measured. The SAT was performed for an average of 1h by the two observers and 45min when volunteers were assisting the observers. To avoid any biases, the scats identified by the volunteers were checked by the experienced observers before being confirmed as koala presence. A presence was recorded for each plot once one or more scats were found and each tree where scats were found was noted. Koala activity levels for each plot were calculated as the percentage of trees with scats within the 30trees sampled. The total number of trees with scats was divided by the total number of trees searched per plot, thus indicating the koala activity and tree use across KFP (Phillips and Callaghan in press). Active plots were defined by any level of activity and variation in activity level was assumed to be normally distributed (Phillips et al. 2000). (EcoAccess Permit Number – WISP05347908)

        Pitfall trapping&amp;#xA;The standard pitfall trap design consisted of a single white 20L plastic bucket, buried flush with the ground and aligned centrally along a 10m section of 300mm high drift fence. However, this design was not always possible and had to be modified due to obstructions at some plots. The drift fence was made of polyethylene dampcourse,which was buried approximately 2cm into the ground and secured in place with wooden stakes every 2m. After the first sampling period, the wooden stakes were replaced with galvanised metal rods, 5mm thick. Buckets were 30cm in diameter and 40cm deep. Four small holes were punctured in the bottom of each trap to allow for drainage and a small square of polystyrene foam was placed in the bottom of the trap in case it filled with water. A layer of leaf litter was also placed in the bottom of the trap to provide protection from predators and overheating.Limited time and volunteer availability meant that this study had to be simplified to one trap per site, which given the lack of data on this topic, is justified. Where possible, the pitfall trap was located 125m along and 5m off to the left-hand side of the plot midline. Traps were open for three consecutive nights, which corresponds to the highest capture success experienced by Moseby and Read (2001). Traps were checked every morning, as this has been demonstrated to be one of the more effective ways to reduce capture-related mortalities (Longmore and Lee, 1981; Hobbs and James, 1999). Traps were open for a total of 297 trap nights over the three survey periods: 10th September 2007 - 5th October 2007, 5th November 2007 - 30th November 2007, 6th January 2008 - 1st February 2008. Species were identified using “A Field Guide to Reptiles of Queensland” (Wilson 2005).Note: Plot A6 could not be surveyed for lizards as the low- lying ground at the plot was frequently inundated with water.References:Hobbs, T.J. and James, C.D.

Each plot was sampled for four nights, with three to four plots being surveyed simultaneously. Twenty-five Elliot traps, three pitfall traps and six hair funnels were used per plot. Elliot traps were placed 11 m perpendicular to the midline on each side and at 20 metre intervals, starting at 20 m along the transect. A final Elliot trap was placed on the line at the 250 m mark. Elliot traps were baited with balls that consisted of a mixture of honey, peanut butter and rolled oats. One pitfall traps were placed 5 m from the midline at the 125 m mark on the left hand side. The pitfall traps consisted of a 20 L bucket and 10 m of drift fence. The hair funnel traps were placed every 35 m along the transect on alternate sides and 6 m from the midline.

        Sample collection&amp;#xA;Soil samples within each plot were taken at a depth of 10cm at six points (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250m) along the plot midline and bulked to produce a composite sample from the six sub-samples for each plot. Prior to analysis the composite soil samples were dried at room temperature, cleaned of stones and fine roots, and passed through a 2mm sieve according to protocol outlined by Kalra and Maynard (1991). The sieved particulates (≤ 2mm) were sent to The School of Land, Crop and Food Sciences at University of Queensland (UQ) for further analysis. The samples (33) were packaged in separate bags each containing approximately 50g of soil, and each bag was labelled with the appropriate site/plot name. Analyses included soil size particle distribution (% silt, clay and sand) using the hydrometer method described by Kalra and Maynard (1991). The soil nutrient analyses included pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), total phosphorous (P), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), magnesium ions (Mg2&amp;#38;#43;), potassium ions (K&amp;#38;#43;), sodium ions (Na&amp;#38;#43;), calcium ions (Ca2&amp;#38;#43;), nitrates (NO3-) and nitrites (NO4&amp;#38;#43;). (EcoAccess Permit Number WISP05347908).&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;Chemical analysis (by University of Queensland)&amp;#xA;Handbook section refers to "The Australian Handbook of Soil and Water Chemical Methods", Rayment GE and Higginson FR, Inkata press, 1992.pH / EC1:5 soil water extracts are prepared and mixed for 1 hour. Conductivity and pH electrodes are used to measure the respective properties. Handbook section : 3A1, p15 and 4A1, p17.Colwell P1:30 soil solution extracts in 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate are prepared and mixed for 16 hrs, with the extracted phosphorous present being determined colorimetrically on centrifuged and filtered extracts using a Pharmacia Ultrospec 2000 spectrophotometer and the ammonium molybdate / ascorbic acid colour reaction with potassium antimonyl tartrate added to control the reaction rate.Calculation: Sample concentrations obtained above in mg/L are converted to mg/kg by multiplying by the volume and dividing by the weight. Handbook section : 9B1, p64.Exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg and Na) and CEC 1:10 soil solution extracts are prepared in 1 M ammonium chloride and mixed for 1 hr, with the exchangeable bases being determined on centrifuged and filtered extracts using a Varian Vista Pro ICPOES instrument.Calculation: Sample concentrations obtained above in mg/L are converted to mg/kg by multiplying by the volume and dividing by the weight. Conversion to meqv or centimoles per unit charge is done by dividing the mg/kg results by the atomic molecular weight and then by dividing again by either 10 for monovalent species (Na and K) or 5 for divalent species (Ca and Mg). The CEC result is the summation of the meqv results for each of the 4 cations. ESPis the sodium percentage of the CEC result, while SAR is the sodium concentration divided by the square root of half the combined results for calcium and magnesium. Handbook section: 15E1, p164.Carbon and nitrogen0.5 g of sample is weighed out into a ceramic boat and acidified with 5 M HCl to remove any inorganic carbonates that may be present in the sample. The acidified sample is then placed into the induction furnace of a LECO CNS 2000 combustion analyser set at 1100 degrees C and calibrated on EDTA. The carbon present is combusted to CO2 which is determined with an infra red detection cell. The nitrogen present is combusted to N2, NO2 and NO. Theoxides are reduced to N2 which is determined quantitatively using a thermal conductivity cell.Calculation: Results are automatically expressed as weight percentages. To convert to mg/kgmultiply the Wt % result by 10000. Handbook section: 6B3, p36.Ammonium nitrogen1:10 soil solution extracts in 2 M potassium chloride are prepared and mixed for 1 hr, with the extracted ammonium nitrogen present being determined colorimetrically on centrifuged and filtered extracts using a SEAL AQ2&amp;#38;#43; colorimetric analyser. The chemistry used is the reaction of ammonia with sodium salicylate and nitroprusside in a weakly alkaline buffer in the presence of free chlorine to produce an easily determinable ammonium salicylatecomplex using at a wavelength of 650 nm.Calculation: Sample concentrations obtained above in mg/L are converted to mg/kg by multiplying by the volume and dividing by the weight. Reference (not in handbook): A manual Colorimetric Procedure for Measuring Ammonium; Baethgen, WE; Commun in Soil Sci Plant Anal; 20 (9 and 10); p 961.Nitrate nitrogen1:10 soil solution extracts in 2 M potassium chloride are prepared and mixed for 1 hr, with the extracted nitrate nitrogen present being determined colorimetrically on centrifuged and filtered extracts using a SEAL AQ2&amp;#38;#43; colorimetric analyser. The chemistry used reduces the nitrate to nitrite using a cadmium reduction column and then measures the colour produced by reacting the nitrite with sulfanilamide and NED at 540 nm.Calculation: Sample concentrations obtained above in mg/L are converted to mg/kg by multiplying by the volume and dividing by the weight. Handbook section: 7B1, p45.&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;Physical analysis (by Sarah Butler)&amp;#xA;Soil particle size and particle distribution was analysed using the “Bouyoucos Hydrometer Method” outlined in the “Methods manual for forest soil and plant analysis” by Y. P. Kalra and D. G. Maynard, Forestry Canada, 1991. The samples were taken through the steps of the analysis to estimate the relative proportion of clay, silt and sand particles in the soil.

        Measurement of altitude, slope and aspect&amp;#xA;Altitude, slope, aspect were measured within each plot. Altitude/elevation was measured from the topographic maps of Karawatha viewed in ESRI, Arc GIS software, which had elevation data incorporated into the attribute data in the shapefiles. Aspect was measured by taking a compass bearing and slope was measured with clinometers perpendicular to the elevation contour within each plot midline. These measurements were made every 50m, totalling 6 measurements per plot.

        Determination of vertical vegetation profile&amp;#xA;Vertical vegetation profiles were determined at each of 33 plots using the methods outlined by Condit (1998). Vegetation transects were completed along the entire 250m plot length, 10m to the right of each plot midline. At 10m intervals a 5m telescopic pole was vertically erected to determine the presence or absence of vegetation within ten height classes. Below 5m the presence or absence of vegetation was determined at 1m intervals, while intervals of 5-10m, 10-15m, 15-20m, 20-30m and &amp;#38;#62;30m were assessed visually above the 5m stratum. Within each stratum the 26 estimates were averaged to obtain a single value for each plot (i.e. one value per stratum). (EcoAccess Permit Number – WISP05347908).Reference:Condit, R. 1998.

        Tagging, identification and DBH sampling&amp;#xA;All woody stemmed trees and shrubs are individually tagged (using aluminium tags) and identified within each 1 hectare plot. Woody stems (trees and shrubs) that were rooted within plots were mapped, species determined and diameters at breast height (DBH) measured. A hierarchical design was used to sample trees of different size classes in order to estimate tree density. Trees with DBH 1cm-10cm and height greater than 1.3m were sampled within 0.1ha (4m x 250m) of the plot. Trees with DBH 10cm-30cm were sampled within 0.5ha (20m x 250m) of the plot. Trees with DBH ≥ 30cm were sampled with 1ha (40m x 250m) of the plot.The DBH of a tree is recorded at 130cm, unless a tree has a disfigurement on the trunk which would cause an irregular DBH measurement. When this occurs the DBH was recorded at 10cm below DBH. When another disfigurement occurs at this height the DBH was recorded 10cm above the DBH. When another disfigurement occurs at this height the DBH is recorded greater then 10cm below or above the DBH. All DBH locations are required and noted on the data sheet e.g.: 10cm above DBH. DBH was measured using veinier callipers or a DBH measuring tape. The method used was noted; e.g. 'C' when using callipers. The DBH measurement on any slope or incline was taken from the lowest side of the tree.If a tree has more than one trunk or branch at DBH height and meets the DBH requirements of it's zone, all trunks and branches will be measured and recorded. Any tree, branch or trunk that is dead will only be measured if it has a DBH of 100mm or greater. A dead tree constitutes a tree without living leaves. The position of the tag resides of the largest living trunk or branch.When a tree has more than one trunk over the specified DBH measurement it must be noted on the data sheet how many trunks and where the trunks are growing from, example: “two trunks from ground”.Distance from the transect involved a measuring tape being held horizontally from the plot midline to the centre of the base of the tree from the point closest to the midline and the point furthest from the midline. When on a slope or incline the measuring tape was kept horizontal from the plot midline to the tree by using poles that were used to lift the tape up from the plot midline or up from the centre of the tree. The distance along the transect is measured by holding a measuring tape at a 90 degree angle to the plot line. and recording the distance along the midline tape.All trees are individually tagged with their own identification number. The identification number consists of the plot code and the tree number eg. F5 – 00001. The identification number is written from left to right starting from the end of the tag to the hole in the tag. Tags are fastened to the trees using either nails or polyethylene tie depending on the size of the tree and where nailing is appropriate. If using a polyethylene, tie to allow growth in thetree. The identification tags are placed at a height of 1.4m above the ground (10cm above DBH).

        Woody vegetation was surveyed at 33 one-hectare plots in Karawatha Forest Park. The plots are at 500 m intervals in a grid that covers the entire Park. Each plot follows the elevational contour and is 250 m long x 40 m wide. Individual woody plants were tagged, identified to species level and measured for DBH, during January and February 2009. Information about the growth of the trees along the transects can be used to estimate the biomass within Karawatha Forest. This can be used to calculate the carbon sequestration of Karawatha Forest and inform of other characteristics related to the trees themselves.

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The study was conducted in the Logan and Albert Estuaries and SMB, South East Queensland. Stream flow data was collected at gauging stations located near to the freshwater outflow of the Logan and Albert Rivers. Water quality samples were collected throughout the duration of the flood event at the gauging stations and analysed for sediment and nutrient concentration. Catchment loads of nutrients and sediments were calculated using flow data and water quality sampling results. Soil samples were collected from various locations that were identified as potential sources of sediment eroded from the catchment during the January flood events. These included hillslope soils as well as actively eroding channel banks. Estuarine suspended sediment and deposited sediment samples were also collected along the estuarine reaches of the Logan and Albert Rivers. Samples were analysed to determine a soil signature through the use of “fallout” tracers (210Pb, 137Cs, Pu) and major and minor elements. Sampling of the Logan and Albert Estuaries and SMB was carried out on seven occasions between January and March 2008 at 32 sites. Parameters measured were: salinity, temperature, pH, turbidity and dissolved oxygen. In addition, samples were collected for laboratory analysis of total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients (NH4, NOx, DON, TP) and chlorophyll a. Refer to EHMP Annual Technical Report 2006-07 (2008) for more detailed methods. Nutrient limitation of phytoplankton was determined for all SMB sites using a PhytoPAM and horizontal tows were undertaken to collect phytoplankton and zooplankton samples (mesh size 100 μm). Seagrass depth range data was collected by field observation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      </name>
      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Annual collection of geo-tagged video imagery of shoreline habitats using the Shoreline Video Assessment Method (SVAM) employed by trained community members and organisations. Video imagery is collected using a Sony Handycam from a shallow-draft boat travelling parallel to the shoreline at a distance of ~25m, at a speed between 4 and 6 kts. The video camera is positioned to record directly perpendicular to the direction of travel at all times. Shoreline video imagery is collected with a concurrent time-synchronised 2-second interval GPS track to provide spatial reference to the imagery. Voice recording of observations on mangrove species composition, structure, condition and threats are made during recording with local observations and context provided by a local MangroveWatchers. Shoreline mangrove forest features are recorded from the video using visual criteria-based classification. The video is first divided into 1-second jpeg frame images. The video time stamp and GPS track enable each frame to be related to a position along the shoreline (+/- 10m). Using ArcGIS 10.0, the shoreline is divided into 10m sections and each section related to a video frame such that the imagery seen between 2 frame locations represents 10m of shoreline. The 10m sections of coastline are then classified according to a set of visual criteria designed by the MangroveWatch Hub.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Data collected during interviews from 152 clients who entered Logan House between March 2011 and April 2013. The ages of participants ranged from 20 to 64 years.Design and treatment;The study followed a prospective longitudinal design, with the social identity measures taken in the first week of treatment, at 2, 4, 6 weeks, at exit from the TC, and at follow-up planned for 6 months after they left the TC. There was some attrition at each time point, as is typical in TC treatment (e.g., Darke, Campbell, and Popple [2012] reported that 17% of treatment entrants dropped out in the first week, and only 34% successfully completed the treatment program). The number of participants at each assessment point was: 132 at entry, 92 at 2 weeks, 71 at 4 weeks, 54 at 6 weeks, 27 at exit from the TC, and 60 at follow-up. One reason for the low number at exit is that a substantial proportion of departures from the TC were unplanned and many occurred for rule violations (such as substance use while residing at the TC). This made it challenging for the researchers to obtain exit data in a majority of cases. The average length of stay at the TC was 99 days (SD = 76 days). Multiple attempts were made to contact every participant at the follow-up (an average of 7 months after leaving the TC) to ensure that the sub-sample was as representative as possible. A series of t-tests were conducted on demographic, substance use, and social identity variables at admission to the TC to investigate possible group differences between the subsample that were followed up (N = 60) and those who were lost to follow-up (N = 72). The t-tests showed no significance differences on substance-use history, well-being, or identity variables. The only significant difference was on years of education completed, which was higher in those included in the follow-up (M = 11.18, SD = 2.017) than in those lost to follow-up (M = 10.41, SD = 1.956). However, as both subsamples had an average of lower than secondary school education, and education was not included in any of the main analyses, this difference was not considered to have any influence on the findings and the follow-up subsample may be considered as representative of the original full sample.Procedure;Potential participants were identified by the manager of the TC when they were settled and ready to be interviewed, typically during their first week. They were then approached by a member of the research team and interviewed using the Addiction Severity Index, and then given a packet of questionnaires to complete and return. The researcher remained nearby to offer help if required. Participants were offered chocolates and cans of soft drink for completing each assessment point. The follow ups were conducted using contact details that the participants had given on their consent form. Follow-up surveys were conducted over the telephone (42%), in person (37%), and by mail (22%). Participants were reimbursed $30 for their completed follow ups. All measures and procedures were approved by the University Of Queensland Ethics Review Committee (approval #2011000953).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

        The Reclink Model;Participants were recruited from two Reclink networks in South East Queensland. Reclink established a profile in 2006 through its Choir of Hard Knocks for adults experiencing homelessness and disadvantage in Melbourne. A documentary about the choir was shown on ABC television in 2007. Reclink is a national organisation that networks existing government and non-government agencies in an area of need, to provide sporting and recreational group activities for members at low or no cost. The agencies refer their clients in to Reclink activities based on their clients’ interests, and the agencies provide various levels of support (such as transport, and carer support) for their clients as needed.&amp;#xA;Support workers are from a range of professions including social work, occupational therapy, and community services. In this study we recruited adults joining a Reclink recreational group and surveyed them upon joining and again after three months to find out if the group activity had any influence on measures of health, wellbeing, and social connectedness. The Reclink groups were held once a week and included yoga (45 per cent), indoor soccer (26 per cent), art classes (12 per cent), sewing (six per cent) and drumming (six per cent).Participants;Participants were 101 adults aged&amp;#xA;18 to 71 years (mean age = 46 years) and 70 per cent were female. At the first survey, 28 per cent of the sample was in some type of paid work, including only five per cent in full time work. Just under half were in&amp;#xA;their own home, with 17 per cent in social housing, 17 per cent staying with friends/ family, and one per cent in emergency accommodation.&amp;#xA;Forty-five per cent of the sample disclosed that they had been given a formal diagnosis of mental illness, most commonly schizophrenia (14 per cent), schizoaffective disorder (four per cent), bipolar disorder (four per cent), depression (eight per cent) and anxiety disorders (seven per cent). Others alluded to mental health problems but were unsure if they had been diagnosed. In terms of health measures, 30 per cent of the sample smoked cigarettes, 42 per cent were sedentary (exercising less than weekly). We obtained surveys from 49 of the participants three months later. No differences were found at baseline between participants who dropped out compared to those who returned the second survey in terms of their gender, employment status, housing status or mental health diagnosis. The most common reasons for dropping out were that the group was discon- tinued or that the participant obtained employment — meaning they were no longer available to attend. Of the 49, the vast majority (93 per cent) reported that they had attended a Reclink group weekly.

      <description type="brief">
        Project currently underway;&amp;#xA;Relapse rates for alcohol and drug dependence are high, with limited understanding of what factors promote abstinence and wellbeing over the longer term. To address this gap, the proposed project will systematically examine the role of social networks and group memberships on recovery from drug dependence. In a world’s first, this project will examine whether individuals who successfully recover undergo a social identity transformation, and if so, how this occurs. Novel insights from this project will inform our understanding of how individuals recover from addiction, with opportunities for informing current treatment approaches and developing innovative interventions.

        <namePart>Scavenging potential: a potential ‘ecoassay’ for measuring the health of estuaries</namePart>
      </name>
      <description type="full">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sampling;Platters -Platters were used to measure scavenging rates. They were made from steel wire bent into a ring (400 mm dia.). Honeycomb mesh netting (holes: 4 mm) was threaded onto the ring such that a cone was formed when a 220g weight was attached to the centre of the netting. A spherical float was attached to the ring in three places so that the platters remained perpendicular to the float line when retrieved but lay flat on the substratum whilst soaking. Two undamaged pilchards (Sardinops sagax) were used as carrion for each platter. On retrieval of the platters from the estuary, any remaining carrion was collected and weighed. For each platter, the proportion of carrion scavenged during the soak time was calculated.BRUVS -The assemblage of scavengers was recorded using baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs). Water proof camera housings were made from PVC gas pressure pipe and clear acrylic. A water proof seal was achieved by applying pressure to a single O-ring (5 mm dia.) which separated the two parts of the housing. Snap locks held the two parts in place. The housing was mounted on a plywood platform. A PVC tube extended 500 mm from the platform and terminated with a 200 × 200 mm carrion platter (4 mm mesh). This platter was raised 60 mm above the level of the platform so that it did not bury in the sediment when the platform was resting on the substratum (Figure 4.2). A Sony Mini-DV camcorder (DCR-HC26e) was placed inside the housing and recorded activity in the field of view for 60 – 90 minutes. In clear water, the horizontal field of view was 60 cm at the carrion net. When deployed at night, the carrion platter was illuminated with an 8 LED torch, which was covered with red cellophane (peak transmittance λ &amp;gt; 680 nm) because many fish and crustacea are unresponsive to red and far red light (Cronin and Forward 1988, Cappo et al. 2004). The torch was positioned to minimise backscatter. Two undamaged pilchards (Sardinops sagax) were used as carrion for each BRUV. Platters and BRUVs were separated from each other by at least 60 m to increase independence of samples.Experimental design;Over six days (9 – 15 Mar 2007), sampling was done once in each of the nine estuaries. It was not possible to sample all estuaries on the same day because of the large spatial scale. Platters were deployed during a flooding tide within a 2 km stretch of each estuary, and were separated by at least 60 m. Fifteen platters in total were available, they were split into two groups and simultaneously soaked in the estuaries for 30 min (n = 8 platters per estuary) or 90 min (n = 7). The preliminary power investigations described in Chapter 4 indicated that a minimum of 7 platters were necessary to stabilise the variance around the mean proportion scavenged in a sampling event. At the same time and in each estuary, three BRUVs were deployed in a similar location to the platters. Scavenging activity was recorded for 90 min. These data provided information about the proportion of carrion scavenged by individual taxa&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The scavenging potential was measured and the assemblage was sampled in nine estuaries in southeast Queensland, spanning 200 km of coastline. The EHI is calculated for 19 estuaries within this region (EHMP 2007). The estuaries were haphazardly selected so that they spanned the region and represented the full range of EHI values, from 0.2 to 1.0. To reduce spatial confounding among estuaries, the sites selected within each estuary were restricted to being within 7 km of the mouth and having extensive sections of muddy mangrove habitat.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

The labs each involve a three-week immersive engagement process, which is based on a methodology developed during my doctoral research. The labs involve three daily recording sessions; sunrise, midday and dusk. Each recording session is approximately two hours, with a custom-made quadrophonic hydrophone rig attached to a moving kayak. These recordings are databased onsite, and made available online for analysis at the Australian Rivers Institute.&amp;#xA;&amp;#xA;In addition to the kayak recordings, other field kits are distributed on location to capture sounds without human intervention. These include a stationary hydrophone that records from the same location during the entire field lab and a series of smaller field kits to capture the soundscapes above the water. The additional field kits are useful to analyse particular sound sources in the hydrophone recordings that might be difficult to identify. The recording sessions are accompanied by community workshops and creative development experiments involving streaming and processing the hydrophone recordings. The team will facilitate a range of community events and will also collaborate with existing programs in each river community.
