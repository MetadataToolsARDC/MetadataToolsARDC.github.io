      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Professor Mackay-Sim is a neuroscientist interested in using stem cells for two purposes: for understanding causes of neuropsychiatric diseases and for transplantation repair of the nervous system. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; He is using patient-derived stem cells to understand the cellular causes of two genetically complex diseases: schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, and two disease caused by mutations in single genes: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, and ataxia telangiectasia. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; He uses adult stem cells from the olfactory mucosa, the organ of smell in the nose and has established NeuroBank, a biobank of olfactory stem cells from more than 300 people with various neurological diseases. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; He is also using induced pluripotent stem cells generated by genetically engineering skin cells from patients with schizophrenia and Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; Professor Mackay-Sim was scientific director of a clinical trial in which cells from the nose (called &amp;quot;olfactory ensheathing cells&amp;quot;) were transplanted into the injured spinal cord to test their safety in three paraplegic patients.

&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Transnational histories.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The purpose of these programs is to facilitate the effective channelling of the Centre membership’s multi-disciplinary research expertise into a series of targeted research projects clustered under the program themes. Although each program reflects to some extent discrete disciplinary interests within the centre, the aim is not to confine the work of any given Centre member to one program, but rather to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration between Centre members and also with members of other Centres within the AEL group. International collaboration is also becoming an increasingly more significant aspect of Centre research. All four Centre research programs have generated projects, seminars and other forms of academic exchange involving overseas collaborators.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Culture, identity and lifestyle&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research program brings together on-going research by cultural sociologists in the Centre focusing on aspects of cultural consumption and cultural practice in contemporary urban and regional settings in local and global contexts. A number of projects are currently in progress, including popular music and cultural memory, street music and the urban soundscape, festivals and public culture, youth culture and mediation, and sexualities and subcultures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Engaging audiences&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research program consolidates a key strength of the Centre in the area of media and journalism studies. Current and on-going projects include research on ethnic minorities use of community-based talk back radio, indigenous media across Australia, the role of the media in the representation of terrorism and national security. Following a highly successful visit to the College of Communication at the National Cheng Chi University, Taiwan, projects around community journalism and the use of digital media in disaster relief are currently being planned with NCCU colleagues.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Material and textual narratives&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research program combines Centre research strengths in areas of cultural sociology, history, literature and journalism to examine the aspects of material and textual culture and their significance in everyday life. Current projects cover: the history of the book; reading practices in Australian society; the ritual significance of material objects in death and remembering.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Transnational histories&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research program combines the specialisms of Centre members working in the field of historical studies. Fields of expertise include indigenous history (in Australian, pan-Pacific and global contexts), studies of Victorian society, indigenous rock art, and local / Queensland studies. The rationale of the trans-national histories program is provide a forum for understanding how each of these areas of historical interest combine to provide new insights into the relationship between the local and the global in historical and contemporary cultural contexts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Centre encourages partnerships with cultural institutions, public agencies and local government and community and corporate organisations. Through a program of publication, public lectures, workshops and symposia, we aim to make the processes and outcomes of Centre-based research available to public audiences as well as scholarly communities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Research Professor, Griffith Institute for Educational Research Senior Academic Fellow, Griffith Institute for Higher Education (Higher Degree Research Education) Professor Parlo Singh’s research work focuses on issues of educational equity and social justice. Specifically she is interested in research partnership work that assists students from disadvantaged communities gain access to complex forms of knowledge. This research has involved working with primary and secondary schools in Queensland, Australia, as well as work in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia through funded research projects. Issues of educational inequity have inevitably dealt with the dynamics of social class, gender, and cultural identity, and theorisations of policy, curriculum, pedagogy and assessment. Of particular significance is work that challenges the re-production of social inequity via schooling systems through complex sociological theorising. Parlo has been a member of the international symposium extending the sociology of Basil Bernstein, particularly his theorisations of curriculum and pedagogy, and strategies for disrupting educational inequality. Parlo migrated at a young age to Australia from India and speaks Punjabi, which was her first language. Her research work has focused on the educational experiences of Asian international students, as well as the work of Australian teachers working offshore in Asia-Pacific countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, China and Papua New Guinea. Parlo has held numerous leadership positions in the university sector. She was the inaugural Director of the Research Centre for Language, Literacy and Diversity (2000-2003), Faculty of Education, QUT. She has also held the position of Head of School, Education and Professional Studies, Faculty of Education, Gold Coast campus (2006-2009). In this role she reinvigorated the Teacher Education Industry Advisory group in order to develop productive university-schools partnerships to develop innovative practice-oriented teacher education programs and effective educational research collaborations. From 2009-2012, Parlo held the position of Dean, Griffith Graduate Research School which involved strategic leadership in the area of higher degree research (HDR) across all academic disciplines and all campuses of Griffith University. In this role, Parlo's leadership was central  to establishing the Board of Graduate of Research and Chairing this university committee to ensure strategic HDR policy renewal and implementation. Professor Singh is the recipient of numerous excellence in teaching awards, including the 2009, Australian College of Educators, National Fellow Award for higher degree research education and training.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description type="brief">&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Marian Drew's art practice in photography, video drawing and sculpture explores the connection of domestic activity to cultural identity and the relationship to place through an acknowledgment of history and the physical engagement with landscape. Her recent work explores the image of the European Still Life genre in the context of Australian roadkill. After completing her degree in 1984, she was awarded a German Government Scholarship to study experimental photography in Germany. Since that time her work has been recognized thorough grants, awards and residencies in Australia, Europe and theUS. Currently she is convenor of Photography programs at the Queensland College of Art, and is represented by commercial galleries in Australia, New Zealand and the US. She represented Australia in the First Asia Pacific Triennial in 1992 and her first major monograph was published in 2006 by the Queensland Centre for Photography. Her work is represented in State and National collections in Australia and international private collections.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
